The priest and the woodcutter are recounting the story of a murdered samurai whose body the woodcutter discovered three days earlier in a forest grove. Both were summoned to testify at the murder trial, the priest who ran into the samurai and his wife traveling through the forest just before the murder occurred. Three other people who testified at the trial are supposedly the only direct witnesses: a notorious bandit named Tajômaru, who allegedly murdered the samurai and raped his wife; the white veil cloaked wife of the samurai; and the samurai himself who testifies through the use of a medium. The three tell a similarly structured story - that Tajômaru kidnapped and bound the samurai so that he could rape the wife - but which ultimately contradict each other, the motivations and the actual killing being what differ. The woodcutter reveals at Rashômon that he knows more than he let on at the trial, thus bringing into question his own actions. But another discovery at Rashômon and the resulting actions from the discovery bring back into focus the woodcutters own humanity or lack thereof.","Top rated movie #147 | Nominated for 1 Oscar, 9 wins & 5 nominations total",Akira Kurosawa,"Ryûnosuke Akutagawa, Akira Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto","Toshirô Mifune, Machiko Kyô, Masayuki Mori","Crime, Drama, Mystery",Daiei,Japanese,Not Rated,165143,8.2,98.0,250000.0,46808.0,46808.0,"unreliable narration,medium,contradictory accounts,multiple perspectives,rape",0,1,9,14,10,3.6666666666666665,7,1,December,12.11577572251966,3028943.930629915,-2461828.700610215, Drama

He just has to make sure a trains schedule meets the required sailing schedule which meets the required coach schedule and so on. As such, he takes up what ends up being the highly publicized twenty thousand pounds sterling wager from his fellow members at the London Reform Club to do so, losing the bet which would ruin him financially. Along for the ride is Foggs new, loyal and devoted valet, the recently arrived Latin immigrant, Passepartout, who possesses unusual skills which could be major assets, but whose all consuming thoughts on the opposite sex could take away his focus from the task at hand. Although Fogg has accounted for certain transportation delays, he may not account for cultural peccadilloes he may encounter along the way which could also cause delays. He is also unaware of the true reason a man name Fix is following them, he who could also derail Foggs task permanently. As Fogg and Passepartout proceed on their journey, they get into one misadventure after another. Ultimately, Fogg may find other things in life more important than winning the bet.","Won 5 Oscars, 13 wins & 5 nominations total","Michael Anderson, John Farrow","James Poe, John Farrow, S.J.

Each of the five have a specific reason for wanting his share of the money: Johnny, in wanting to get married to his longtime girlfriend Fay, the two who have known each other since they were kids, realizes that to live comfortably, he has to shoot for the moon instead of carrying out the penny-ante stuff that put him behind bars; Marvin Unger, a bookkeeper who is bankrolling the plan, is doing it out of his friendship and loyalty to Johnny; Randy Kennan, a crooked police officer, is already late with his repayment to a loan shark; Mike OReilly, one of the tracks bartenders, wants to be able to provide better overall care, most importantly medical, to his bedridden wife, Ruthie OReilly; and milquetoast George Peatty, one of the tracks ticket clerks, is trying to buy back the love of his shrew of a wife of five years, Sherry Peatty, if he ever had her love at all. The elaborate plan requires meticulous timing by all seven men. Beyond any unforeseen problems causing the plan to fail, what the other four team members are unaware of is that weak-minded George told Sherry of the broad issue that he will be involved in a heist in an effort to hold on to her emotionally; she, in turn, told her boyfriend Val Cannon, with Sherry and Val having their own ideas of absconding with the entire take of the heist after the fact.","Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award, 1 nomination total",Stanley Kubrick,"Stanley Kubrick, Jim Thompson, Lionel White","Sterling Hayden, Coleen Gray, Vince Edwards","Crime, Drama, Film-Noir",Harris-Kubrick Productions,English,PG,88525,8.0,91.0,320000.0,,203.0,"heist,heist gone wrong,police shootout,femme fatale,one last job",0,0,0,1,11,4.333333333333333,4,1,June,10.899491967222826,3487837.429511304,-3485624.832641958, Film-Noir

Helen uses the word sensitive to describe Carols overall demeanor, which is almost like she walks around in a daze, rarely speaking up about anything. When she does speak up, it generally is about something against one of those few issues on which she obsesses, such as Helens boyfriend Michaels invasion of her space at the apartment. That specific issue may be more about men in general than just Michaels actions, as witnessed by Carol being agitated by hearing Helen and Michaels lovemaking, and she not being able to rebuff the advances effectively of a male suitor, Colin, who is infatuated with her. One of those other obsessive issues is noticing cracks and always wanting to fix them. While Helen and Michael leave on a vacation to Pisa, Italy, Carol chooses largely to lock herself in the apartment, ditching work. There, she is almost hypnotized by her solitude, which leads to her mental state deteriorating as those obsessions come to the fore. She quickly descends into madness, which ultimately also affects those that are trying to get in touch with her.","Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award, 2 wins & 4 nominations total",Roman Polanski,"Roman Polanski, Gérard Brach, David Stone","Catherine Deneuve, Ian Hendry, John Fraser","Drama, Horror, Thriller","Compton Films, Tekli British Productions",English,Not Rated,52592,7.6,91.0,300000.0,,33174.0,"mental illness,female protagonist,hallucination,delusion,fear of sex",0,0,2,6,9,2.6666666666666665,7,1,October,9.432671617167884,2829801.485150365,-2516882.0369224376, Horror

He is there to follow up on a letter addressed specifically to him from an anonymous source on Summerisle reporting that a twelve year old girl who lives on the island, Rowan Morrison, the daughter of May Morrison, has long been missing. The correspondence includes a photograph of Rowan. Upon his arrival on Summerisle, Howie finds that the locals are a seemingly simple minded lot who provide little information beyond the fact that they know of no Rowan Morrison and do not know the girl in the photo. Mrs. Morrison admits to having a daughter, seven year old Myrtle, but no Rowan. As Howie speaks to more and more people, he begins to believe that Rowan does or did live on the island, but that the locals are hiding their knowledge of her. He also begins to see that the locals all have pagan beliefs, their religion which centers on procreation as the source of life. That procreation does not necessarily need to be within marriage, and openly flaunts the act of sex, both in private and in public. These beliefs do not sit well against Howies strict Christian morals, he who regularly attends church, prays, and accepts communion. Everything that happens on the island seems to be dictated by Lord Summerisle, whose ancestors bought the island generations ago. Howie begins to believe that Rowan was murdered, she a sacrifice by the islanders to their higher power to ensure a bountiful apple crop - the main crop of the island - which did not materialize last season. With May Day approaching, Howie not only tries to find out if Rowan was indeed murdered/sacrificed, which includes trying to locate her body, but if there will be another sacrifice on this important day within the cycle of life.","Awards, 2 wins & 6 nominations",Robin Hardy,"Anthony Shaffer, David Pinner","Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee, Diane Cilento","Horror, Mystery, Thriller",British Lion Film Corporation,English,R,79250,7.5,87.0,810000.0,60891.0,162007.0,"paganism,religious sacrifice,folk horror,island community,ritual killing",0,0,2,8,1,2.5,5,2,August,6.582139598326371,5331533.074644361,-4265180.3847383, Mystery

The arrangement with his client, known only to him as the director, is to provide the audio recording of the discussion and photographs of the couple directly to him alone in return for payment. Based on circumstances with the directors assistant, Martin Stett, and what Harry ultimately hears on the recording, Harry believes that the lives of the young couple are in jeopardy. Harry used to be detached from what he recorded, but is now concerned ever since the deaths of three people that were the direct result of a previous audio recording he made for another job. Harry not only has to decide if he will turn the recording over to the director, but also if he will try and save the couples lives using information from the recording. As Harry goes on a quest to find out what exactly is happening on this case, he finds himself in the middle of his worst nightmare.","Nominated for 3 Oscars, 14 wins & 16 nominations total",Francis Ford Coppola,Francis Ford Coppola,"Gene Hackman, John Cazale, Allen Garfield","Drama, Mystery, Thriller","The Directors Company, The Coppola Company, American Zoetrope",English,PG,109657,7.8,87.0,1600000.0,4528476.0,4544650.0,"paranoia,surveillance,murder,recording,saxophone",0,3,14,30,11,3.0,15,11,April,6.582139598326371,10531423.357322194,19382097.36821175, Thriller

In the first, a group of research scientists from a variety of backgrounds are investigating the strange appearance of items in remote locations, primarily desert regions. In continuing their investigation, one of the lead scientists, a Frenchman named Claude Lacombe, incorporates the Kodály method of music education as a means of communication in their work. The response, in turn, at first baffles the researchers, until American cartographer David Laughlin deciphers the meaning of the response. In the second, electric company lineman and family man Roy Neary and single mother Jillian Guiler are among some individuals in Muncie, Indiana who experience some paranormal activity before some flashes of bright lights in the sky, which they believe to be a UFO. Roy becomes obsessed with what he saw, unlike some others, especially in some form of authority, who refuse to acknowledge their belief that it was a UFO in not wanting to appear crazy. That obsession both for Roy and Jillian is ratcheted up a notch when they begin to have a vision of a mound with vertical striations on its side as a key to what is going on. While the obsession negatively affects Roys life as he knows it in its entirety, Jillian knows she has to find the answer as to its meaning, especially as it relates to her only child, three year old Barry Guiler, who may be more attuned to what is happening than the adult figures around him. These two stories have the potential to intersect if Roy and Jillian can discover where theyve seen that mound before, and if they can overcome what they believe to be the lies perpetrated by those in authority in covering up what is going on.","Won 1 Oscar, 15 wins & 39 nominations total",Steven Spielberg,"Steven Spielberg, Hal Barwood, Jerry Belson","Richard Dreyfuss, François Truffaut, Teri Garr","Drama, Sci-Fi","Julia Phillips and Michael Phillips Productions, EMI Films","English, French, Spanish, Hindi",PG,198157,7.6,90.0,20000000.0,135189114.0,306889114.0,"alien,mothership,close encounter of the third kind,single mother,vision",1,1,15,54,31,1.3333333333333333,8,2,December,5.137285380114428,102745707.60228856,1473831251.0661817, Sci-Fi

To make money, the teams unknown owner makes its manager, Joe McGrath, do cheesy publicity much to the players chagrin. Rumors abound among the players that if the local mill closes, the team will fold. Just before the official announcement is made, the teams aging player/coach, Reggie Dunlop, does get wind that the mill is indeed closing and that this season will be the teams last. Beyond efforts to reconcile with his wife Francine, who loves Reggie but doesnt love his career, Reggie begins to focus on how to renew interest in the team for a possible sale as he knows if the team folds, his hockey career is over. Without telling anyone of his plan, he begins a rumor that the owner is negotiating a sale with a city in Florida. He also decides that goon hockey - most especially using the untapped talents of the recently acquired childlike but quietly menacing Hanson brothers - is the way to renew local interest. It works as the team begins to attract new fans, sell out games, sell out away games attended largely by their groupies, and win, which does fuel the rumor of a sale. The one team member who doesnt like this new style is Ned Braden, a college graduate who plays the game solely because he loves it. His hockey career is against the wishes of his tomboyish wife, Lily, who hates everything about Charlestown and being a hockey wife. Reggies goal of winning the league championship and having the team sold takes a turn when he finally meets the teams owner and discovers the owners motivations. Ned, with his own views of what is right and wrong in hockey, may come up with an unexpected way to achieve all their goals.","Awards, 1 win & 2 nominations",George Roy Hill,Nancy Dowd,"Paul Newman, Michael Ontkean, Strother Martin","Comedy, Drama, Sport","Kings Road Entertainment, Pan Arts, Universal Pictures",English,R,37133,7.3,61.0,6000000.0,28000000.0,28000000.0,"hockey violence,hockey fight,ice hockey,cult film,hockey movie",0,0,1,3,3,1.0,10,58,February,5.137285380114428,30823712.28068657,113020278.36251742,Comedy

Britons Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell are both naturally gifted fast sprinters, but approach running and how it fits into their respective lives differently. The son of a Lithuanian Jew, Harold, who lives a somewhat privileged life as a student at Cambridge, uses being the fastest to overcome what he sees as the obstacles he faces in life as a Jew despite that privilege. In his words to paraphrase an old adage, he is often invited to the trough, but isnt allowed to drink. His running prowess does earn him the respect of his classmates, especially his running teammates, and to some extent the school administration, if only he maintains what they consider proper gentlemanly decorum, which isnt always the case in their minds. Born in China, the son of Christian missionaries, Eric, a Scot, is a devout member of the Church of Scotland who eventually wants to return to that missionary work. He sees running as a win-win in that the notoriety of being fast gives him an added outlet to spread the word of God, while he sees his speed as being a gift from God, and he wants to run to honor God and that gift. This view does not sit well with his sister, Jennie Liddell, who sees his running as only taking away time from his work to God. Harold and Erics lives do intersect in national races, but it is the one hundred meter track event at the 1924 Paris Olympics which the two men and their supporters most anticipate. Beyond the fact that Americans Charles Paddock and Jackson Scholz are favored in the event, the much anticipated head to head between Harold and Eric may be further shadowed by other issues, especially as it affects Erics Christian beliefs.","Won 4 Oscars, 18 wins & 19 nominations total",Hugh Hudson,Colin Welland,"Ben Cross, Ian Charleson, Nicholas Farrell","Biography, Drama, Sport","Enigma Productions, Allied Stars Ltd.","English, French",PG,59405,7.1,78.0,5500000.0,58972904.0,59303359.0,"1920s,athlete,paris 1924 summer olympics,olympic games,running",4,4,18,37,1,1.0,3,2,April,3.217401606822557,17695708.837524064,173107013.69905087,Biography

That childhood includes not having a male role model with his father having been killed in the war, his overprotective mother smothering him, and an oppressive school system quashing his natural creativity. Being a rock star, he is often wanted more because of what he is than who he is. The most recent failure in that true connection to someone or something else is his marriage, when on tour, he discovers that his wife back home is cheating on him. His response is to go in the opposite direction, by building a figurative wall around him to isolate himself from the rest of the world, but not before showing graphically his feelings on different gut levels. The question becomes if he or anyone else can do anything to tear down the wall in a meaningful way.","Won 2 BAFTA Awards, 3 wins & 2 nominations total",Alan Parker,Roger Waters,"Bob Geldof, Christine Hargreaves, James Laurenson","Drama, Fantasy, Music","Goldcrest Films International, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Tinblue",English,R,80212,8.0,47.0,12000000.0,22244207.0,22265763.0,"drugs,loss of father,adolescence,smashing a tv set,smashing a window",0,0,3,5,7,1.0,3,38,September,3.217401606822557,38608819.281870686,33029082.37145955, Fantasy

The grandson is sure he wont like the story, with a romance at its core, he prefers something with lots of action and no kissing, but he lets grandfather continue, because he doesnt want to hurt his feelings. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of as you wish to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action.","Nominated for 1 Oscar, 7 wins & 10 nominations total",Rob Reiner,William Goldman,"Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Robin Wright","Adventure, Family, Fantasy","Act III Communications, Buttercup Films Ltd., The Princess Bride Ltd.",English,PG,420274,8.0,77.0,16000000.0,30857814.0,30902442.0,"true love,princess,fairy tale,giant,pirate",0,1,7,17,10,5.0,10,1,October,2.666139151924335,42658226.43078936,39731984.07548159, Family

Dr. Malcolm Sayer is hired as a clinical physician at a local hospital in the Bronx, despite he only having a research background. The job is not ideal on his side as he has difficulties relating to people which is the reason he has focused on research projects not involving human subjects, while the hospital hires him somewhat out of desperation in not finding anyone else with the qualifications who wants the job. Most of his patients are in a semi-catatonic state and are housed in what some of the orderlies coin the garden ward, where all they can do for the patients is water and feed them. He notices that some of the patients, despite their generally catatonic state, respond in unusual ways to certain stimuli. In doing some research, he also finds that some common bonds between these patients are that they suffered from encephalitis in the 1920s or 1930s, and that their physical states are like they have Parkinsons disease frozen in time. As such, he is able to convince, albeit reluctantly, his skeptical boss, Dr. Kaufman, to administer an expensive experimental drug therapy on only one patient with family consent. That patient is forty-one year old Leonard Lowe, who has been in his current state since he was eleven years old, and who has been supported by his loving mother through all these years. As the drug therapy awakens Leonard, there are several issues that come into play. Malcolm has to try and convince Kaufman and the hospital administration to extend the therapy to the other patients. Despite not knowing the long term effects, Leonard, who was aware of his surroundings through his catatonic state, may have mixed emotions about his situation, wanting both to be treated as human being and an experiment guinea pig to ensure that what is happening benefits him and others in the long run. Mrs. Lowe may be unprepared for the new Leonard, she expecting who she remembers as a sweet eleven year old boy. Through all these issues, what may be the most illuminating issue for Malcolm is the need to stimulate the human spirit, including his own in dealing with people around him.","Nominated for 3 Oscars, 6 wins & 11 nominations total",Penny Marshall,"Oliver Sacks, Steven Zaillian","Robert De Niro, Robin Williams, Julie Kavner","Biography, Drama","Columbia Pictures, Parkes/Lasker productions",English,PG-13,137742,7.8,74.0,31000000.0,52096475.0,52096475.0,"psychiatric hospital,drug testing,catatonia,encephalitis lethargica,title directed by female",0,3,6,17,4,4.0,43,250,January,2.238053345686371,69379653.7162775,47215036.45593888,Biography

After graduation, she aspires to work in the agencys Behavioral Science Unit under the leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While she is still a trainee, Crawford asks her to question Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, thus far, for eight years in maximum security isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecters brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern U.S., all young women, who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her, as a woman, to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, with her often having to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along, as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine. Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), the warden at the prison, an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, meaning a higher profile for himself if he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.","Top rated movie #22 | Won 5 Oscars, 69 wins & 51 nominations total",Jonathan Demme,"Thomas Harris, Ted Tally","Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Lawrence A.

She, along with the other fairies in the forest, does not believe humans exist, and are only in stories, until a crazy bat by the name of Batty Koda (Robin Williams), comes and tells them all of these crazy stories about how he was captured by humans and experimented on.

Crysta saves Zak from The Leveller, which she thinks is just a monster, but she cannot properly un-shrink him.

They decide to take Zak to Magi Lune, so she can un-shrink him. On the way, Zak sees the forest really for the first time with all of its beauty and life.

She learns of Vinces true business as a gangster when she walks in on him killing one of his employees who wronged him. As a witness to the murder, Deloris goes on the run to the police, Lieutenant Eddie Souther (Bill Nunn), who has long been running an operation to get enough evidence to put Vince behind bars, this murder, which could be the metaphorical nail in Vinces coffin. However, Vince has put a contract out on Deloris life to prevent her from testifying against him. As such, Eddie has to hide her until the trial, which will be at least two months. Where Eddie chooses is St. Katherines, a poor Catholic parish and convent in a tough neighborhood in San Francisco. The convents Mother Superior (Dame Maggie Smith) reluctantly takes Deloris in, that reluctance as Deloris is not anywhere near being close to looking or acting like a typical nun. Furthermore, the Mother Superior does not tell any of the sisters Deloris true identity or the real reason for her being at St. Katherines. With the Mother Superior cloistering the sisters behind the convent walls to pray for the salvation mostly of down and out of the neighborhood while keeping the sisters safe from harms of the outside world, there is an immediate and continual clash of wills between her and Deloris. Deloris, as renamed Sister Mary Clarence, does have an effect on two of the sisters, Mary Patrick (Kathy Najimy), a perpetually perky woman, and Mary Robert (Wendy Makkena), who always feels left behind in whatever is happening in life. The clash between Deloris and the Mother Superior leads to the Mother Superior restricting Deloris to one task at the convent, one that leads to good and bad changes at St. Katherines, the bad most specifically in potentially leading Vince and his associates to Deloris. Those changes also bring the battle of wills between Deloris and Mother Superior to a head, unless each can see the positive in what is happening in relation to their life at the convent.","Awards, 9 wins & 10 nominations",Emile Ardolino,Paul Rudnick,"Whoopi Goldberg, Maggie Smith, Kathy Najimy","Comedy, Family, Music","Touchstone Pictures, Touchwood Pacific Partners 1",English,PG,97147,6.4,51.0,31000000.0,139605150.0,231605150.0,"held at gunpoint,punched in the face,shot to death,dressing room,bra",0,0,9,19,2,2.0,10,71,May,2.147843901810337,66583160.95612043,430868548.09924793, Family

tt0109348,Bullets Over Broadway,Bullets Over Broadway (1994),Movie,1994,1995-02-24,98.0,"1920s Broadway. Playwright David Shayne considers himself an artist, and surrounds himself with like minded people, most struggling financially as they create art for themselves, not the masses. David, however, believes the failure of his first two plays was because he gave up creative control to other people who didnt understand the material. As such, he wants to direct his just completed third play, God of Our Fathers, insider scuttlebutt being that it may very well make David the toast of Broadway. With David having no directing history, Davids regular producer, Julian Marx, cant find any investors,... until a single investor who will finance the entire production comes onto the scene. He is Nick Valenti, a big time mobster, with the catch being that his dimwitted girlfriend, non-actress Olive Neal, get the lead role. A hesitant David and Julian, who are able to talk Nick into them giving Olive one of the two female supporting roles instead, go along with the scheme hoping that the three other actors hired will be able to make up for any deficiencies posed by Olive. What makes Olives situation worse for David is that Nick has placed a bodyguard named Cheech - a typical thug who kills if need be - on Olive, he a constant presence at the theater during rehearsals. David is unaware or mindfully ignorant of issues concerning the other actors. Helen Sinclair, who has the lead, is a diva of an actress, who hasnt had a hit in years. Regardless, she is slyly manipulating David to make the role more glamorous befitting her real life persona than the frigid character he has written. Gossip is that Warner Purcell, the only male among the cast, has a roller coaster of a weight problem. Currently on a low, Warner tends to eat and eat and eat when when he gets stressed. And Eden Brent, a happy-go-lucky actress, has a constant companion in her pet chihuahua, Mr. Woofulls, whose presence is a constant thorn in Helens side.

Because of the difficulty traveling and the dangers, especially as the landscape is still heavily booby-trapped with mines, Hana volunteers to stay behind at a church to care solely for a dying semi-amnesiac patient, who is badly burned and disfigured. She agrees to catch up to the rest of the unit after he dies. All the patient remembers is that he is English, and that he is married. Their solitude is disrupted with the arrival at the church of fellow Canadian David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), part of the Intelligence Service, who is certain that he knows the patient as a man who cooperated with the Germans. Caravaggio believes that the patients memory is largely intact, and that he is running away from his past, in part, or in its entirety. The patient does open up about his past, all surrounding his work as a cartographer in North Africa, which was interrupted by the war. He may not be running from his work as a spy for the Germans as Caravaggio believes, but rather the memory of an affair he had with married Katharine Clifton (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas), the love of his life, and the memory of a promise not totally fulfilled. Hana may also test her theory of her fates with love and death as she embarks on a relationship of her own with Kip Singh (Naveen Andrews), a Sikh from India, whose unit has camped on the now overgrown lawn of the church. Their work entails sweeping for and diffusing mines, the discovery of one such mine which had earlier saved her life.","Won 9 Oscars, 62 wins & 77 nominations total",Anthony Minghella,"Michael Ondaatje, Anthony Minghella","Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, Willem Dafoe","Drama, Romance, War","Miramax, Tiger Moth Productions","English, German, Italian, Arabic",R,188204,7.4,87.0,27000000.0,78676425.0,231976425.0,"patient,nurse,flashback,english,church",9,9,62,139,3,2.5,37,40,December,1.9194985582105568,51826461.07168503,393451952.25465435, War

They grew up in Hells Kitchen, a far from perfect neighborhood, one filled as Shakes says with scams and shake downs, but one where the rules were known and easily understood by its residents. The one adult who they admired was Father Bobby Carelli, who understood them as kids more than most adults and more than he himself would like to admit. In 1967, their lives would change forever when a typical teenage prank went wrong which led to the four of them being sentenced to various terms at Wilkinson Home for Boys, a reformatory. There, they were physically, emotionally and sexually abused primarily by Sean Nokes, the predatory lead guard of their cell block, and fellow guards Ralph Ferguson, Henry Addison, and Adam Styler, although there were other decent figures of authority at the home, including a few other guards. Their time at the home affected the four, not all who were able to emerge from the experience to regroup their lives. In their want to forget about the experience, they made a vow not to talk about it either between themselves or with others. Fast forward thirteen years, with Tommy and Johnny being career criminals, Michael an assistant district attorney and Shakes a newspaper writer, their friendship on the surface more loose than it was when they were children. When Tommy and John unexpectedly spot Nokes at a local restaurant, it leads to Shakes and Michael banding together to exact revenge not only on Nokes but all four of the guards who abused them. Michael had long mapped out a plan even before Tommy and John saw Nokes, but that sighting and its aftermath alters the plan. Beyond the precarious position Tommy and John place themselves into, Michael has the most to lose even if the plan succeeds. Most of the plan implementation is left to Shakes who has to enlist the machine of Hells Kitchen, including mob boss King Benny, and their childhood friend, social worker Carol Martinez, who currently is Johns girlfriend. Beyond co-opting aging lawyer Danny Snyder, who admits he may not be the best choice as an alcoholic who is no longer near the top of his game, the plan is threatened by a key piece, the need for an unreproachable figure to perjure him or herself, that person who Michael and Shakes hopes will be Father Bobby. Father Bobby, even if he knew of the abuse, may not be able to do his friends this enormous favor of an illegal nature, he who has to balance the morality of the situation in his own mind in deciding what to do.","Nominated for 1 Oscar, 1 win & 5 nominations total",Barry Levinson,"Lorenzo Carcaterra, Barry Levinson","Robert De Niro, Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt","Crime, Drama, Thriller","Astoria Films, Baltimore Pictures, Polygram Filmed Entertainment",English,R,216794,7.5,49.0,44000000.0,53315285.0,165615285.0,"child molestation,sexual abuse,sexual predator,sadistic rape,pedo",0,1,1,6,9,2.5,51,7,October,1.9194985582105568,84457936.5612645,233440364.21386597, Drama

Her current work in monitoring for extraterrestrial life is based on that love and is in part an homage to her father. Ever since funding from the National Science Foundation (N.S.F.) was pulled on her work, which is referred to some, including her N.S.F. superior David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt), as more science fiction than science, Ellie, with a few of her rogue scientist colleagues, have looked for funding from where ever they could get it to continue their work. When Ellie and her colleagues hear chatter originating from the vicinity of the star Vega, Ellie feels vindicated. But that vindication is short lived when others, including politicians, the military, religious leaders, and other scientists, such as Drumlin, try to take over her work. When the messages received from space are decoded, the project takes on a whole new dimension, which strengthens for Ellie the quest for the truth. Thrown into the mix are the unknown person who has up until now funded most of Ellies work and what his motivations are, and Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), a renowned author and theologian, who despite their fundamental differences in outlook, is mutually attracted to Ellie, that attraction based in part on intellect and their common goal of wanting to know the truth.","Nominated for 1 Oscar, 14 wins & 32 nominations total",Robert Zemeckis,"James V.

Behind one of the filing cabinets in his work area, Craig finds a hidden door which he learns is a portal into the mind of John Malkovich, the visit through the portal which lasts fifteen minutes after which the person is spit into a ditch next to the New Jersey Turnpike. Craig is fascinated by the meaning of life associated with this finding. Lottes trips through the portal make her evaluate her own self. And the confident Maxine Lund, one of Craigs co-workers who he tells about the portal if only because he is attracted to her, thinks that it is a money making opportunity in selling trips into Malkovichs mind after office hours for $200 a visit. Craig, Lotte and Maxine begin to understand that anyone entering the portal has the ability to control Malkovichs mind, which also alters his entire being. This experience makes Maxine fall in love with a composite. This ability to control Malkovichs mind begs the question of the ultimate psychedelic trip for Malkovich himself, who begins to feel that something is not right in the world as he knows it.","Nominated for 3 Oscars, 48 wins & 79 nominations total",Spike Jonze,Charlie Kaufman,"John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener","Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Astralwerks, Gramercy Pictures (I), Propaganda Films",English,R,330328,7.8,90.0,13000000.0,22863596.0,23106667.0,"puppeteer,portal,body swap,subjective camera,chimpanzee",0,3,48,127,4,4.0,45,6,December,1.793003857357676,23309050.14564979,18121292.91602953, Drama

James had been openly gay even during his working period and is in declining health. Having been recently released from a hospital where he was recuperating from a stroke, he left with some permanent health issues, the aftermath of the stroke. Much against the disapproval of his loyal longtime housekeeper Hanna, his health does not prevent him from toying with the handsome young men who may wander into his midst in his continuing homosexual desires, although Hanna is as much, if not more concerned about any of those young men taking advantage of him in his elderly and fragile state. The young man who catches his eye among the most recent is Clayton Boone, who Hanna had hired to do garden work around the property. Clay, an ex-marine from the proverbial wrong side of the tracks, has no idea who James was or is before he starts this job. James and Clay soon begin a friendship of sorts. Clay is also unaware of James homosexual orientation before such is confirmed by Hanna, an issue which threatens his masculinity, especially in light of the cracks showing in his casual sexual relationship with a slightly older and wiser diner waitress named Betty. Clay has to reconcile that threat against being in the company of someone whom he considers an interesting and once famous man. The friendship and his state of health related to the stroke lead James to reflect in a bittersweet vein on key points of his life, most notably serving in WWI, and as a result reveals his ulterior motives through the actions he takes toward Clay.","Won 1 Oscar, 38 wins & 33 nominations total",Bill Condon,"Christopher Bram, Bill Condon","Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, Lynn Redgrave","Biography, Drama","Lions Gate Films, Showtime Networks, Flashpoint (I)","English, Hungarian",R,30818,7.4,74.0,10000000.0,6451628.0,6451628.0,"homosexual,gay interest,film history,film director,homosexuality",1,1,38,71,9,2.0,10,11,November,1.8216919190753988,18216919.19075399,-6464040.598273411, Drama

To fulfill that emotional need, he has an heirloom pocket watch with Kellys photo that she gave him as a Christmas present, and eventually opening the FedEx packages, a Wilson volleyball on which he paints a face and which he names Wilson. As time progresses, Chuck goes through a range of emotions, but if rescue is ever in the cards, he realizes that he has to find a way to get off the island, which is seemingly impossible in his circumstance due to the strong on shore surf he cannot get beyond without assistance. What Chuck may not fully realize is the longer he is not rescued, the harder it will be for him to return to his old life in its entirety if he ever is rescued. Although the thought of Kelly is what largely keeps him motivated to be rescued, Kelly, who probably believes him to be dead, may have moved on emotionally from him in the intervening time.","Nominated for 2 Oscars, 15 wins & 38 nominations total",Robert Zemeckis,William Broyles Jr.,"Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, Paul Sanchez","Adventure, Drama, Romance","Twentieth Century Fox, Dreamworks Pictures, ImageMovers","English, Russian",PG-13,576044,7.8,73.0,90000000.0,233632142.0,429632142.0,"survival,remote island,lost at sea,survivor,crash survivor",0,2,15,53,17,3.0,42,179,December,1.7544069054380391,157896621.4894235,595852975.2335126,Adventure

What only Kathy knows among Selmas friends is that she is slowly going blind from a genetic medical condition. She can see just enough to be able to do her job.

tt0169547,American Beauty,American Beauty (1999),Movie,1999,1999-10-01,122.0,"After his death sometime in his 43rd year, suburbanite Lester Burnham tells of the last few weeks of his life, during which he had no idea of his imminent passing. He is a husband to real estate agent Carolyn Burnham and father to high school student Jane Burnham. Although Lester and Carolyn once loved each other, they now merely tolerate each other. Typical wallflower Jane also hates both her parents; the three suffer individually in silence in their home life. Jane tries to steer clear of both her parents. Carolyn, relatively new to the real estate business, wants to create the persona of success to further her career, aspiring to the professional life of Buddy Kane, the king of the real estate business in their neighborhood. Lester merely walks mindlessly through life, including at his job in advertising. His company is downsizing, and he, like all the other employees, has to justify his position to the newly hired efficiency expert to keep his job. Things change for Lester when he falls in love at first sight with Janes more experienced classmate, Angela Hayes. Both Janie and Angela can see Lesters sexual infatuation with Angela, who courts such attention from any man as a sign that she is model material, she having once appeared in Seventeen and is a career to which she aspires. Lesters infatuation with Angela gives him a reenergized view on life, where he openly doesnt care anymore what anyone thinks about what he does, anyone except Angela. This infatuation coincides with the Fittses moving in next door: homophobic disciplinarian US Marine Colonel Frank Fitts who rules the house with a military fist (that fist being both figurative and literal), his semi-comatose wife Barbara Fitts, and their bright and quietly subversive 18-year-old son Ricky Fitts, who openly abides by his fathers rules while behind the scenes lives by his own quite different perspective. Much like Lesters infatuation, Ricky immediately becomes infatuated with Jane; he considers girls like Angela as ordinary. The entry of Angela and the Fittses into the Burnhams lives ultimately leads to each of the players confronting what is truly in his or her heart.","Top rated movie #66 | Won 5 Oscars, 111 wins & 102 nominations total",Sam Mendes,Alan Ball,"Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch",Drama,"Dreamworks Pictures, Jinks/Cohen Company",English,R,1130059,8.4,84.0,15000000.0,130096601.0,356296601.0,"midlife crisis,adulterous wife,cheating wife,unfaithful wife,virgin girl",5,5,111,213,8,1.0,17,60,October,1.793003857357676,26895057.86036514,611946122.0960637,Drama

Tawny Madison (a role which consisted solely of repeating what the computer stated, much to Gwens chagrin), Shakespearean trained Sir Alexander Dane as alien Dr. Lazarus, Fred Kwan as engineer Tech Sergeant Chen, and Tommy Webber as child pilot Laredo. Eighteen years after the series last aired, it lives on in the hearts of its rabid fans. However, it lives on in infamy for its stars, who have not been able to find meaningful acting work since. Their current lives revolve around cashing in on however those roles will afford, which usually entails attending fan conventions or worse, such as electronic store openings. Only Jason seems to relish his lot in life, until he finds out that his co-stars detest him because of his superior attitude as the Commander, and much of the public considers him a laughing stock. Their lives change when Jason is approached by who he thinks are convention fans asking for help. They are in reality an alien race called Thermians, led by Mathesar, who have modeled their existence after the series, which they believe to be real. When Jason and then the rest of his co-stars (along with Guy Fleegman, who was killed off before the opening credits in only one episode) go along with the Thermians, Jasons co-stars who believe they are off to yet another paying gig, they learn that they have to portray their roles for real. Without screenwriters to get them to a happy and heroic ending, they have to trust that their play acting will work, especially in dealing with the Thermians nemesis, General Sarris. Guy in particular fears that he will go the way his character did on the series. But when they run across technical issues that they as actors didnt care anything about during the filming of the series and thus now dont know how to deal with, they need to find someone who should know what to do.","Awards, 7 wins & 14 nominations",Dean Parisot,"David Howard, Robert Gordon","Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman","Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi","Dreamworks Pictures, Gran Via Productions",English,PG,161595,7.4,70.0,45000000.0,71583916.0,90683916.0,"parody,sexy woman,alien,actor,fanboy",0,0,7,21,4,1.5,22,60,December,1.793003857357676,80685173.58109543,81911437.60720405, Comedy

Born in 1950, Beverly grew up bright and ambitious in a working-class neighborhood in Connecticut; her father was a tough but good-hearted cop who listened to his daughters problems, and her mother was a nervous woman eager to imagine the worst. From an early age, Beverly displays a keen intelligence and an interest in literature, and dreams of going to college in New York and becoming a writer. However, she also develops an early interest in boys, and at 15 finds herself madly in love with a boy from her high school. However, an attempt to get his attention leads to an embarassing incident at a party, and Ray, a sweet but thick-headed 18-year-old, steps forward to defend her. Beverly and Ray end up making out, and after one thing leads to another, Beverly discovers shes pregnant. Telling Ray is only marginally less difficult than informing her parents, and at 16, Beverly is a wife and mother. Against the odds, Beverly is determined to still finish high school and go on to college, but that goal becomes more difficult with time, especially after Beverlys marriage begins to fall apart. Ray tries to do the right thing but has trouble holding a job, and becomes addicted to heroin.","Awards, 2 wins & 2 nominations",Penny Marshall,"Beverly DOnofrio, Morgan Ward","Drew Barrymore, Steve Zahn, Adam Garcia","Biography, Comedy, Drama","Columbia Pictures, Gracie Films, Parkway Productions",English,PG-13,28815,6.5,43.0,48000000.0,30165536.0,35743308.0,"single mother,pregnant teenager,father daughter relationship,drug addiction,teenage pregnancy",0,0,2,4,4,1.0,19,250,October,1.6967184772128037,81442486.90621458,-20796155.785906352, Drama

Until now. Based on the true story of the Beast of the Gevaudan that terrorized France in the eighteenth century, the movie aims to tell first and explain afterwards. In the first part, a special envoy of the King of France, altogether biologist, explorer and philosopher, arrives in the Gevaudan region, in the mountainous central part of France. The Beast has been attacking women and children for months and nobody has been able to harm it or even take a good look at it. In the second part, our hero Chevalier de Fronsac will not only have to fight the Beast, but also ignorance, bigotry and conspiracy and will rely on two women, one an aristocrat, the other a prostitute, as well as the enigmatic Mani, an Iroquois he met in New-France (Canada).","Awards, 4 wins & 22 nominations",Christophe Gans,"Stéphane Cabel, Christophe Gans","Samuel Le Bihan, Mark Dacascos, Jérémie Renier","Action, Adventure, Drama","Metropolitan Filmexport, Canal+, Davis-Films","French, German, Italian",R,66229,7.0,57.0,29000000.0,11260096.0,70752904.0,"fortuneteller,18th century,beast,reference to voltaire&apos;s l&apos;ingenu,reference to georges louis leclerc",0,0,4,26,2,1.0,3,29,January,1.650504355265373,47864626.30269582,68913349.89697702,Action

A fifth girl, plump and insecure, agrees, but they end up making out under the bleachers. When a group of school bullies catches them, the girl claims that Jeremy attacked her. This causes them to strip off his clothes and beat him up in front of the entire school. Flash forward to 2001. We meet the five girls who were in that school gym: Kate, Paige, Shelly, Lily and the formerly plump Dorothy. They are all in their 20s now and trying to sort out their love lives, which is appropriate, since Valentines Day is coming up. After a disastrous date with a loser, one of the girls, a pre-med student, is murdered by a Cherub-mask wearing killer who sent her a death threat in the form of a Valentine card prior to the attack. After the four remaining girls are reunited at her funeral, they all start receiving threatening cards and messages. At first they dont know who would want to hurt them, but eventually they figure that maybe Jeremy is responsible. Police records show that Jeremy has completely disappeared, so no one knows what he looks like.

A ten-year-old boy named Carlos, the son of a fallen Republican war hero, is left by his tutor in an orphanage in the middle of nowhere. The orphanage is run by a curt but considerate headmistress named Carmen and a kindly Professor Casares, both of whom are sympathetic to the doomed Republican cause. Despite their concern for him, and his gradual triumph over the usual schoolhouse bully, Carlos never feels completely comfortable in his new environment. First of all, there was that initial encounter with the orphanages nasty caretaker, Jacinto, who reacts even more violently when anyone is caught looking around a particular storage room the one with the deep well. Second, and more inexplicable, is the presence of a ghost, one of the former occupants of the orphanage named Santi. Not long after Carlos arrival, Santi latches onto Carlos, badgering him incessantly at night and gloomily intoning, Many of you will die. As if that wasnt enough to keep the orphanages occupants in an unrelenting state of terror, theres the un-exploded bomb that dominates the orphanages courtyard, still ticking away; With the orphanage left defenseless by its isolation, and the swift progression of Francos troops, the ghosts prediction seems depressingly accurate. Nevertheless, with every step of the plot, it becomes apparent that the ghosts predictions as to who (or what) will die, the real source of danger and even the definition of death itself may be more ambiguous than first thought.","Awards, 6 wins & 11 nominations",Guillermo del Toro,"Guillermo del Toro, Antonio Trashorras, David Muñoz","Marisa Paredes, Eduardo Noriega, Federico Luppi","Drama, Horror, Thriller","El Deseo, Tequila Gang, Sogepaq",Spanish,R,65385,7.4,78.0,4500000.0,755249.0,6582065.0,"orphanage,spanish civil war,sex,gold bar,gold",0,0,6,17,11,3.6666666666666665,4,3,April,1.6967184772128037,7635233.147457616,3532678.156258076,Drama

In the later stages of his career, he takes his job lightly now, filing stories only on occasion, and no longer doing field work. But most importantly, this posting allows him to escape from what he considers a dreary life in London, including an unsatisfying marriage to a Catholic woman, who will never grant him a divorce, which in turn allows him to have an affair with a young Vietnamese ex-taxi dancer named Phuong, whom he loves and would marry if he were able. Phuongs sister doesnt much like Fowler, if only because he cannot provide a stable future for her. His idyllic life is threatened when the head office suggests he go back to London. In this way, he decides to write a major story to prove to his superiors that he should stay in Saigon. In 1952, Fowler is called into the local Police Inspectors office to provide any information on his friend, thirty-ish American Alden Pyle, who has been found murdered. Fowler had met Pyle the previous year when he arrived in Vietnam to work as part of the American contingent in the Economic Aid Mission. Fowler and Pyles relationship was not always harmonious, initially as Pyle admitted he too was in love with Phuong and wanted to marry her. That antagonistic relationship would extend to their professional lives, around Fowler believing that the story that would allow him to stay in Vietnam was the rise of a man named General Thé, and Pyles belief that a third power should come in to take over Vietnam from both the French and the Communists. The question becomes whether Fowler knows more about Pyles demise than he lets on to the Inspector.","Nominated for 1 Oscar, 13 wins & 14 nominations total",Phillip Noyce,"Graham Greene, Christopher Hampton, Robert Schenkkan","Michael Caine, Brendan Fraser, Thi Hai Yen Do","Drama, Romance, Thriller","Miramax, Intermedia Films, Mirage Enterprises","English, French, Vietnamese",R,28268,7.0,84.0,30000000.0,12988801.0,27674124.0,"year 1952,first indochina war,french indochina,asia,french colonial empire",0,1,13,27,10,2.0,15,40,March,1.6245121606942647,48735364.82082794,-3778413.8462669337, Thriller

Nathan West, as well as several of his elite Special Forces trainees on what appears, at first, to have been a routine training exercise during a hurricane in the jungles of Panama. Only two survivors are found, Dunbar, and a badly wounded Kendall, the son of a high-profile Joint Chiefs of Staff official. Neither is willing to cooperate with Capt. Julia Osbornes investigation. So base commander Col. Bill Styles calls in ex-Ranger Hardy, an old friend and a persuasive interrogator. Osborne disapproves of Hardy who is on leave from the D.E.A. after having come under suspicion of accepting bribes from local drug traffickers. She is also uneasy when she learns that Hardy once trained under West and hates him almost as passionately as his current recruits. With time running out, Hardy and Osborne call a temporary, if uneasy, truce. Hardy cajoles a confession out of Dunbar, who claims that Sgt. West and the missing Rangers have been murdered and their bodies blown away by the hurricane. When they later interview Kendall, he confirms that the other Rangers and West are dead. But, in almost every other way, his story contradicts Dunbars. What happened to West and his Ranger team? And what were they really doing out there in the jungle? As each layer reveals more lies and greater deceptions, Hardy and Osborne inch towards the horrible truth about the fate of the missing Rangers.","Awards, 3 nominations",John McTiernan,James Vanderbilt,"John Travolta, Samuel L.

Charlie wants to be faithful to the book in his adaptation, but despite Laroche himself being an interesting character in his own right, Charlie is having difficulty finding enough material in Laroche to fill a movie, while equally not having enough to say cinematically about the beauty of orchids. At the same time, Charlie is going through other issues in his life. His insecurity as a person doesnt allow him to act upon his feelings for Amelia Kavan, who is interested in him as a man. And Charlies twin brother, pretentious Donald, has moved into his house with a goal of also becoming a screenwriter. Despite not admiring Donald as a screenwriter, Charlie asks for his advice. Together, they feel that there is some interesting subtext in the book on which Orlean herself can only elaborate, if only Charlie has the nerve to talk to her. If she cant or wont elaborate, they may have to find out the meaning of that subtext on their own.","Won 1 Oscar, 65 wins & 100 nominations total",Spike Jonze,"Susan Orlean, Charlie Kaufman","Nicolas Cage, Meryl Streep, Chris Cooper","Comedy, Drama","Beverly Detroit, Clinica Estetico, Good Machine","English, Latin",R,190133,7.7,83.0,19000000.0,22498520.0,32801173.0,"loneliness,thief,twin,writing,magical realism",1,1,65,165,4,2.0,55,4,February,1.6245121606942647,30865731.05319103,22420173.370345347, Drama

As such, he realizes that he is perceived as different than most kids, as even the self-professed weird kids dont want to hang out with him as he is the target of bullying. Part of the taunts against him are the fact that he sings and speaks to himself without even realizing that he is doing it.

Barrie (James)s latest effort has garnered less than positive reviews, something he knew would be the case even before the plays mounting. This failure places pressure on James to write another play quickly as impresario Charles Frohman needs another to replace the failure to keep his theater viable. Out for a walk with his dog in part to let his creative juices flow, James stumbles upon the Llewelyn Davies family: recently widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (the daughter of now deceased author George L. Du Maurier) and her four adolescent sons. James and the family members become friends, largely based on he and the boys being able to foster in each other the imagination of children, James just being the biggest among them in this regard. Sylvia also welcomes James into their lives, he who becomes an important and integral part of it. Among the six of them, the only one who does not want to partake is Sylvias third, Peter Llewelyn Davies, who is still grieving the reality of their lives, where his father was there one day planning an outing for the family, and gone the next. Two other people who dont appreciate James in the Llewelyn Davies lives are: his wife, Mary Barrie, who always feels the need to be the responsible one in their relationship and who feels threatened by his friendship with an unmarried woman; and Emma du Maurier, Sylvias overbearing mother, who sees him as an obstacle to Sylvia moving on with her life with another potential husband, and an impediment to maintaining discipline within the boys. James still hopes to bring Peter out of his self-imposed shell, but in the process comes up with an idea for another play based on an amalgam of himself and Peter, that play which eventually becomes what Charles sees as a largely unmountable and thus doomed production called Peter Pan. This process of helping Peter could take a step backward when it looks like Sylvia may imminently befall a similar fate to that of her late husband.","Won 1 Oscar, 19 wins & 81 nominations total",Marc Forster,"Allan Knee, David Magee","Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Julie Christie","Biography, Drama, Family","Miramax, FilmColony, Keylight Productions",English,PG,204775,7.7,67.0,25000000.0,51680613.0,116650613.0,"stage play,author,reference to peter pan,dog,costume",1,1,19,100,8,2.0,50,40,December,1.5879884268761142,39699710.67190286,145540112.76010153,Biography

They are: ex-cop, now limo driver Ed and his client Caroline, a diva of a once-famous actress; quiet adolescent Timmy, his stepfather George, and his mother Alice, who was seriously injured when Ed accidentally ran over her as she watched George change their flat tire; prostitute Paris, who was the unwitting cause of Georges flat tire; newlyweds Lou and Ginny, whose marriage is based on a lie; and Police Officer Rhodes, who was en route escorting prisoner Robert to his new institution. None can leave because of washed-out roads, all the other businesses around the motel are closed because of the storm, and all communication in and out is not functioning also because of the storm. One by one, they are murdered, the murderer leaving a calling card of a motel room key, starting with the room 10 key and working his way presumably to the room 1 key when the last person will be dead.

George, who has a reputation as a ladys man, has had as his legal counsel a series of beautiful female lawyers with questionable credentials, they who have more primarily acted as his casual sex partners. Needing a real lawyer, he offers Lucy the job of his legal counsel on a chance meeting. Despite warnings from her parents in working for the enemy, Lucy, who has no intention of being the latest in his bed partners, accepts the job as she feels she can do more good from the inside, and as George, as part of the job offer, promises not to demolish a community center in a heritage building as part of a development project near her childhood Coney Island home where her parents still live.

As such, she gives him two weeks notice, although she promises to help George find her replacement. As Lucy begins to review resumes, George himself unilaterally decides to hire June Carver, a fellow Harvardite, but who seems to have her sights set on George as both a boss and personal partner.

Daniels (Liam Neesons) wife has just died, leaving him to take care of his adolescent stepson Sam (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) by himself. Daniel is uncertain how to deal with Sam and his problems without his wife present, especially in light of a potential budding romance within their household. Juliet (Keira Knightley) and Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) have just gotten married. They believe that Peters best friend and best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln) hates Juliet, but wont say so to his or her face. Others looking at the situation from the outside believe Mark is jealous of Juliet, as he is in love with Peter. Jamie (Colin Firth), a writer, is taking a writing retreat by himself in rural France following catching his latest girlfriend (Sienna Guillory) in an indiscretion. Jamie ends up spending much time in France with Aurelia (Lúcia Moniz), the Portuguese woman hired as the housekeeper. The question becomes not only if they can communicate their day-to-day needs with each other as she speaks no English, he speaks no Portuguese, and neither speaks French very well, but communicate what seems to be their increasing mutual attraction to each other. Sarah (Laura Linney) has been in love with her co-worker Karl (Rodrigo Santoro) for the two years they have worked together, this attraction about which everyone in their workplace knows. Sarah has to decide if she can be forward enough to express this love directly to Karl, especially in light of what has been her personal priority of dealing with a family issue. Harry (Alan Rickman) and Karen (Dame Emma Thompson) have been in a stable long term marriage. His new assistant Mia (Heike Makatsch) drops hints to him that she would like them to be romantically involved. Harry has to decide whether to fall to the temptation, especially considering being married to a perceptive wife. Single and relatively young David (Hugh Grant) is the newly elected Prime Minister. At 10 Downing Street, he is attracted to one of the new household servants, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon), but isnt sure what to do about it seeing as to their respective positions, the probable public scrutiny, and an incident involving the visiting U.S. President (Billy Bob Thornton). Socially unaware Colin Frissell (Kris Marshall) believes that the lack of romantic love in his life is all the fault of standoffish British women. As such, he decides to take decisive albeit somewhat unusual geographic action. And John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) are movie body doubles. They can communicate with each other straightforwardly while they are simulating sex filming a movie, but they may not be able to translate the feelings behind that simulation in real-life to each other.","Won 1 BAFTA Award, 10 wins & 29 nominations total",Richard Curtis,Richard Curtis,"Hugh Grant, Martine McCutcheon, Liam Neeson","Comedy, Drama, Romance","Universal Pictures, StudioCanal, Working Title Films","English, Portuguese, French",R,474574,7.6,55.0,40000000.0,59696144.0,245203167.0,"christmas,adultery,unrequited love,love at first sight,prime minister",0,0,10,39,3,6.0,25,286,November,1.6245121606942647,64980486.42777059,333355040.20447606,Comedy

Although connected indirectly through Wills mother/Edwards wife, Sandra Bloom, Will has been estranged from his father for three years since his and Josephines wedding. Wills issue with his father is the fanciful tales Edward has told of his life all his life, not only to Will but the whole world. As a child when Edward was largely absent as a traveling salesman, Will believed those stories, but now realizes that he does not know his father, who, as he continues to tell these stories, he will never get to know unless Edward comes clean with the truth before he dies. On the brink of his own family life beginning, Will does not want to be the kind of father Edward has been to him. One of those stories from Edwards childhood - that he saw his own death in the glass eye of a witch - led to him embracing life since he would not have to fear death knowing when and how it would eventually come. The question is whether Will will be able to reconcile Edwards stories against his real life, either directly from Edward before he dies and/or from other sources, and thus allow Will to come to a new understanding of himself and his life, past, present and future.","Nominated for 1 Oscar, 69 nominations total",Tim Burton,"Daniel Wallace, John August","Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup","Adventure, Drama, Fantasy","Columbia Pictures, Jinks/Cohen Company, The Zanuck Company","English, Cantonese",PG-13,435762,8.0,58.0,70000000.0,66809693.0,123218424.0,"storytelling,fish,father son relationship,death of father,flashback",0,1,0,69,19,4.0,22,250,January,1.5879884268761142,111159189.881328,84510241.40858604, Drama

A blacksmith named Balian has lost his family and nearly his faith. The religious wars raging in the far-off Holy Land seem remote to him, yet he is pulled into that immense drama. Amid the pageantry and intrigues of medieval Jerusalem, he falls in love, grows into a leader, and ultimately uses all his courage and skill to defend the city against staggering odds. Destiny comes seeking Balian in the form of a great knight, Godfrey of Ibelin, a Crusader briefly home to France from fighting in the East. Revealing himself as Balians father, Godfrey shows him the true meaning of knighthood and takes him on a journey across continents to the fabled Holy City. In Jerusalem at that moment--between the Second and Third Crusades--a fragile peace prevails, through the efforts of its enlightened Christian king, Baldwin IV, aided by his advisor Tiberias, and the military restraint of the legendary Muslim leader Saladin Ayubi. But Baldwins days are numbered, and strains of fanaticism, greed, and jealousy among the Crusaders threaten to shatter the truce. King Baldwins vision of peace--a kingdom of heaven--is shared by a handful of knights, including Godfrey of Ibelin, who swear to uphold it with their lives and honor. As Godfrey passes his sword to his son, he also passes on that sacred oath: to protect the helpless, safeguard the peace, and work toward harmony between religions and cultures, so that a kingdom of heaven can flourish on earth. Balian takes the sword and steps into history.","Awards, 5 wins & 15 nominations",Ridley Scott,William Monahan,"Orlando Bloom, Eva Green, Liam Neeson","Action, Adventure, Drama","Twentieth Century Fox, Scott Free Productions, BK","German, English, Arabic, Latin, Italian",R,283636,7.2,63.0,130000000.0,47398413.0,218122627.0,"crusader,12th century,jerusalem,templar,knights templar",0,0,5,20,23,5.0,26,179,May,1.54623994827275,201011193.2754575,136258726.21413884,Action

Frances supported her husband financially as he was writing his own book, and he sues her for alimony despite her financial difficulties. And he wants to keep the house. Frances eventually accepts her best friend Pattis offer of a vacation, a gay tour of Tuscany which Patti and her lesbian partner Grace originally purchased for themselves before Patti found out that she is pregnant. The gift is a means to escape dealing with the divorce, from which Patti feels Frances may never recover emotionally without some intervention. Feeling that Pattis assessment may be correct in that she has too much emotional baggage ever to return to San Francisco, Frances, while in Tuscany, impulsively ditches the tour to purchase an aged villa, which ends up being a fixer-upper. Frances has many obstacles in eking out a productive and happy life in her new surroundings, that happy life which she hopes will eventually include rediscovering romantic love. In a discussion with sympathetic real estate agent Signor Martini, Frances outlines what emotionally she wants to accomplish with the villa, despite none of those items in a substantive material sense currently being in her life. In response, Martini tells her the story of a set of railroad tracks that were laid between Vienna and Venice before an engine that could make the trek being built, a train which now regularly travels the route. The question becomes whether Frances, in going through the process, will be laying another Vienna to Venice track, and if so whether that end product emotionally will be exactly as she envisions.","Awards, 5 nominations",Audrey Wells,"Frances Mayes, Audrey Wells","Diane Lane, Raoul Bova, Sandra Oh","Comedy, Drama, Romance","Touchstone Pictures, Timnick Films, Blue Gardenia Productions","English, Italian, Polish, French, Spanish, German",PG-13,52078,6.7,52.0,18000000.0,43610723.0,58878723.0,"villa,writer,book,vacation,author",0,0,0,5,1,3.0,9,71,September,1.6245121606942647,29241218.892496765,66407982.62715234, Drama

Car maker Charles Howard is no different, he who is trying to rebuild his life after the tragic death of his only child and the resulting end of his first marriage. With second wife Marcela at his side, Charles wants to get into horse racing and ends up with a team of underdogs who are also chasing their own dream. The first is trainer Tom Smith, who has a natural instinct to spot the capabilities of horses. The second is the horse Tom chooses for Charles, Seabiscuit, an unconventional choice as despite his pedigreed lineage, Seabiscuit is small at fifteen and a half hands tall with a slight limp. But Tom can see something in Seabiscuits nature to make him a winner, if only Seabiscuit can be retrained from his inbred losing ways. And third is the jockey they decide to hire, Johnny Red Pollard, so nicknamed because of his hair color. Like Tom, Red has always shown a natural way with horses, but a difficult upbringing due solely to the Depression has made Red an angry young man, which has gotten him into trouble both on and off the track. And he is large for a jockey, and thus he always feels the need to battle the weight issue. Another common trait between Tom, Seabiscuit and Red is that they have been called crazy by those in traditional horse racing circles. Against the odds, Seabiscuit, with his human team behind him, does show his winning abilities and captures the imagination of all those others wanting to believe in a dream. But Seabiscuits victories are at smaller races. As such, Charles aims high and wants Seabiscuit to race Triple Crown winner War Admiral, who by all accounts is a winner and should be a winner. If given the chance to race against War Admiral (whose owner doesnt want to race as he feels he has nothing to prove), will Seabiscuit and his team continue to keep the dreams of the common Americans alive? Through the good and the bad, especially as Red and Seabiscuit face mirroring problems, they all have to decide what is in their collective best interest.","Nominated for 7 Oscars, 6 wins & 44 nominations total",Gary Ross,"Laura Hillenbrand, Gary Ross","Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges, Elizabeth Banks","Drama, History, Sport","Universal Pictures, Dreamworks Pictures, Spyglass Entertainment",English,PG-13,72391,7.3,72.0,87000000.0,120277854.0,148336445.0,"horse movie,animal character name as title,lawnmower,boy horse relationship,girl horse relationship",0,7,6,50,5,1.5,32,286,July,1.6245121606942647,141332557.98040104,99641800.79625493, History

He is past his movie star prime, but his name and image still have enough cachet for him to have gotten this lucrative $2 million job. He has an unsatisfying home life where his wife Lydia follows him wherever he goes - in the form of messages and faxes - for him to deal with the minutiae of their everyday lives, while she stays at home to look after their kids.

The story opens in the Garden of Olives where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, the controversial Jesus--who has performed miracles and has publicly announced that he is the Son of God--is arrested and taken back within the city walls of Jerusalem. There, the leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy; subsequently, his trial results with the leaders condemning him to his death. Jesus is brought before Pontius Pilate, the prefect of the Roman province of Judaea, for his sentencing. Pilate listens to the accusations leveled at Jesus by the Pharisees. Realizing that his own decision will cause him to become embroiled in a political conflict, Pilate defers to King Herod in deciding the matter of how to persecute Jesus. However, Herod returns Jesus to Pilate who, in turn, gives the crowd a choice between which prisoner they would rather to see set free--Jesus, or Barrabas. The crowd chooses to have Barrabas set free. Thus, Jesus is handed over to the Roman soldiers and is brutally flagellated. Bloody and unrecognizable, he is brought back before Pilate who, once again, presents him to the thirsty crowd--assuming they will see that Jesus has been punished enough. The crowd, however, is not satisfied. Thus, Pilate washes his hands of the entire dilemma, ordering his men to do as the crowd wishes. Whipped and weakened, Jesus is presented with the cross and is ordered to carry it through the streets of Jerusalem, all the way up to Golgotha. There, more corporal cruelty takes place as Jesus is nailed to the cross--suffering, he hangs there, left to die. Initially, in his dazed suffering, Jesus is alarmed that he has been abandoned by God his father. He then beseeches God. At the moment of his death, nature itself over-turns.","Nominated for 3 Oscars, 29 wins & 24 nominations total",Mel Gibson,"Benedict Fitzgerald, Mel Gibson","Jim Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, Maia Morgenstern",Drama,Icon Productions,"English, Aramaic, Latin, Hebrew",R,229459,7.2,47.0,30000000.0,370782930.0,612054506.0,"torture,suffering,graphic violence,brutality,sadism",0,3,29,53,4,1.0,11,4,February,1.5879884268761142,47639652.80628343,924295819.3390938,Drama

His career appeared to be finished, he was unable to pay the bills, his family--the only thing that mattered to him--was in danger, and he was even forced to go on Public Relief. But deep inside, James J. Braddock never relinquished his determination. Driven by love, honor, and an incredible dose of grit, he willed an impossible dream to come true. In a last-chance bid to help his family, Braddock returned to the ring. No one thought he had a shot. However Braddock, fueled by something beyond mere competition, kept winning. Suddenly, the ordinary working man became the mythic athlete.

Prok goes on to become a biology professor at Indiana University, initially focusing on the study of gall wasps. But those studies, in combination with questions from his students, coming to terms with the needs of sex with his own wife, a former student of his named Clara McMillen (Laura Linney) (whom he calls Mac), and what he sees as the gross misinformation on the subject currently within popular belief makes him change his focus to human sexuality. Many of those gross untruths - as he sees them - are that oral sex and masturbation cause a slew of maladies, which are perpetuated by what is presented in the universitys hygiene class taught by Professor Thurman Rice (Tim Curry). With the approval of faculty head Herman Wells (Oliver Platt), Prok starts teaching his own wildly popular marriage course, talking about sex in a straightforwardly academic fashion. When he sees that morals dont necessarily mirror sexual behavior, he decides to conduct a massive sex survey with the assistance of students Wardell Pomeroy (Chris ODonnell), Clyde Martin (Peter Sarsgaard), and Paul Gebhard (Timothy Hutton). He faces the issue of the funding required for the survey and public and political response to this controversial, and oft seen as taboo, subject. But in conducting the survey, he and Mac also face the issue of their own sexuality in relationship to their marriage, and the emotional and cultural aspects behind it, such as the notion of love.","Nominated for 1 Oscar, 17 wins & 51 nominations total",Bill Condon,Bill Condon,"Liam Neeson, Laura Linney, Chris ODonnell","Biography, Drama, Romance","Fox Searchlight Pictures, Qwerty Films, N1 European Film Produktions GmbH & Co.

Her dead body is found upstream several weeks later, consistent with the accidental death theory. Based on incidents around him, her grieving husband, architect Jonathan Rivers, decides several months later to visit with Raymond Price, who approached John prior to Annas body being found with news that she was trying to contact him from beyond. At that time, John was skeptical of Raymonds claims of electronic voice phenomena (EVP): that he is contacted from the beyond through electronic means - radio, television - which he is able to record. Along with Sarah Tate, another of Raymonds clients whose fiancé passed away, John becomes obsessed with EVP as he gets more and more audio and video messages, however fuzzy, from Anna from beyond. That obsession takes a slight change in focus when John believes that Anna is trying to pass along information to help others. But the nature of those messages and their connection to Raymond in combination with John learning that not all good comes through EVP leads to the possible belief that he dabbling in EVP in and of itself may be dangerous and the cause of those potentially deadly issues in which he is supposed to assist in helping. John has to decide whether or not to continue with his work in EVP, not continuing which means that he may actually prevent bad things from happening, and continuing which means that he gets his much wanted connection with Anna.","Awards, 1 win & 2 nominations",Geoffrey Sax,Niall Johnson,"Michael Keaton, Deborah Kara Unger, Ian McNeice","Drama, Horror, Mystery","Universal Pictures, Gold Circle Films, White Noise UK Ltd.",English,PG-13,48826,5.5,30.0,10000000.0,56386759.0,91196419.0,"supernatural horror,tape over mouth,television static,river,obsession",0,0,1,3,1,1.0,13,286,January,1.54623994827275,15462399.4827275,125549146.71449253,Drama

After reading a newspaper article about the just occurred November 14, 1959 cold blooded murders of the Clutter family in their rural Kansas home, Truman feels compelled to write about that event as his next article. So he and his personal assistant Nelle Harper Lee, also a southern born New Yorker and an aspiring writer of her own, head to Kansas to research the story first-hand. Truman hopes to use his celebrity status to gain access to whomever he needs, such as to Laura Kinney, a friend of the Clutter daughter she who discovered the bodies, and to Alvin Dewey, the lead police investigator and also a Clutter family friend. If his celebrity doesnt work, Truman will grease the wheels by whatever means necessary. When the police eventually charge suspects, two young men named Dick Hickcock and Perry Smith, Truman uses those same tactics to gain access to them. Trumans fascination with the story makes him believe that he can revolutionize writing by expanding the germ of the article into what he calls a non-fiction novel. His personal involvement also changes as he grows emotionally attached to Perry, the seemingly sensitive and thus probable submissive in the criminal pairing, thus Truman becoming part of the story itself. Article or non-fiction novel, Truman knows that he has to take it to its natural conclusion, something which he cannot force. But also missing are the details of the November 14, 1959 event itself, something that neither Dick or Perry have divulged even in testimony.","Won 1 Oscar, 59 wins & 89 nominations total",Bennett Miller,"Dan Futterman, Gerald Clarke","Philip Seymour Hoffman, Clifton Collins Jr., Catherine Keener","Biography, Crime, Drama","United Artists, Sony Pictures Classics, A-Line Pictures",English,R,132007,7.3,88.0,7000000.0,28750530.0,49327405.0,"kansas,prison,reading,death penalty,book reading",1,1,59,148,3,1.0,19,18,February,1.4953964683488878,10467775.278442215,63296251.951373056,Biography

A golden-boy war hero who single-handedly forced multiple German soldiers to surrender in The Great War, Carter has dashing good looks and unparalleled speed on the field. This new champ is almost too good to be true, and Lexie Littleton (Renée Zellweger) aims to prove thats the case. A cub journalist playing in the big leagues, Lexie is a spitfire newswoman who suspects there are holes in Carters war story. But while she digs, the two teammates start to become serious off-field rivals for her fickle affections. As the new game of pro-football becomes less like the freewheeling sport he knew and loved, Dodge must fight to keep his guys together and to get the girl of his dreams.

This project is beyond their day jobs. The project truly does belong to Aaron and Abe, as they use all their free time working on it, primarily trying to overcome the many engineering related problems theyve encountered. It is during one of his tests with the invention running that Abe discovers that a protein inside the main unit has multiplied much more rapidly than it could in nature. Rather than the invention being a protein super incubator, Abe, using himself as a guinea pig, and a very meticulous one at that, discovers that the invention can be used as a time machine. In his self experiment, Abe was especially careful not to interfere with his own self in that time warp. Abe passes along this discovery to Aaron, who he expects will tell his wife Kara in what is the sanctity of their marriage, but he doesnt want to tell either Robert or Phillip. Much to Abes surprise, Aaron does not want to tell Kara, it being a sole intellectual property of just the two of them, in the process moving the base of operation to a locked storage unit. Aarons plan for the two of them is to use the invention to win big in the stock market by knowing through the time travel what has happened in the market. With two thoughts on the matter now instead of just one, Aaron and Abe may hit some logistical and philosophical roadblocks in how to move forward.","Awards, 3 wins & 7 nominations",Shane Carruth,Shane Carruth,"Shane Carruth, David Sullivan, Casey Gooden","Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller",ERBP,"English, French",PG-13,105422,6.8,68.0,7000.0,424760.0,545436.0,"changing the future,time travel,nonlinear timeline,independent film,invention",0,0,3,10,2,2.0,3,1,May,1.54623994827275,10823.67963790925,832551.2527881864, Thriller

Beyond her extreme grief, Gray, his loving fiancée, the two who were to be married in only a couple of days, is placed in a difficult position as they had no assets in their joint names, and without a will she is legally left with nothing of his except the engagement ring, one half of a family heirloom set along with the wedding ring she was about to receive, the engagement ring which his mother, Ellen, would like back. Gray cannot even afford to live in the rental house she and Grady were to live in, and as such, she, at least in the short term, moves into Gradys old room with his two roommates and best friends, Dennis, Gradys quiet, straight-laced business partner, and somewhat clueless Sam, a copywriter of sorts with Celestial Seasonings Tea. The fourth in that buddy friendship is Fritz, a Los Angeles based director of commercials, he who came in for the funeral and who is staying with Dennis, Sam and now Gray for as long as he is in town. Gray has never much liked seemingly self-absorbed Fritz, his current presence which only strengthens that notion as he displays no sense of anything about Grady, let alone grief. In the process of dealing with his estate, Gray discovers some hidden aspects of what was Gradys recent life, both of a financial nature and an associated personal nature. She turns in part to Gradys friends for answers and support, and while Dennis is the one who wishes she turned to in being secretly in love with her, Gray ends up bonding unexpectedly with Fritz as this information answers a lot of questions she had about his and Gradys friendship. Things within this grouping get even more complicated with the arrival into town from Los Angeles of a woman named Maureen and her preschool aged son Mattie, who are somewhat in the center of that hidden issue concerning Grady.",0,Susannah Grant,Susannah Grant,"Jennifer Garner, Timothy Olyphant, Kevin Smith","Comedy, Drama, Romance","Columbia Pictures, Relativity Media, Tall Trees Productions","English, Sanskrit",PG-13,26242,5.9,43.0,25000000.0,15539051.0,16162580.0,"reference to persephone the greek minor deity,cartoon on tv,f rated,reference to traci lords,death of fiance",0,0,0,0,1,6.0,14,250,January,1.4490275856093875,36225689.64023469,-12805665.365616113, Romance

A company called Zomcon has been able to control the zombie population. Zombies can be temporarily neutralized by being shot, but can only be permanently neutralized by their brain being destroyed. Their ultimate disposal is through cremation, or burial, the latter which requires decapitation with the head being buried separately from the body. Conversely, Zomcon has created the domestication collar, when activated and placed on a zombie makes the zombie controllable, and thus an eternally productive creature within society. Because all dead initially become zombies, the elderly are viewed negatively and suspectly. And all people, adult or child, learn to shoot to kill to protect society. Zomcon is the go to organization for all things zombie. In the town of Willard, the Robinsons - father Bill (Dylan Baker), mother Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss), and adolescent son Timmy (Kesun Loder) - are one family who dont own a zombie as a domestic, since Bill is afraid of zombies, as, when he was a child, he had to shoot his own zombie father, who tried to eat him. Bill has thus become fascinated with funerals to see zombies put away permanently. But Helen feels pressured to get a zombie when Zomcons new head of security in Willard, the officious Jonathan Bottoms (Henry Czerny), moves into the neighborhood with his family. Never having had to deal with a zombie directly, Timmy is initially wary of their zombie. But as a lonely child who has no friends and is often bullied, Timmy eventually befriends their zombie, who he names Fido (Sir Billy Connolly), as he treats the zombie much like a faithful pet dog. Timmy protects Fido at all cost, even after Fido, due to no fault of its own, is implicated in some deaths, which creates a mini-wave of loose zombies unknown to Zomcon. But Fido may play a larger role within the family as a companion for Helen, who is largely neglected by Bill, since he sees human affection as ultimately resulting in such difficult issues as what happened between him and his own father. With Timmy and Helen treating Fido with kindness, Fido, in turn, may prove that not all zombies, even when without their domestication collar, are out to kill anyone and everyone in their path.","Awards, 13 wins & 15 nominations",Andrew Currie,"Robert Chomiak, Andrew Currie, Dennis Heaton","Kesun Loder, Billy Connolly, Carrie-Anne Moss","Comedy, Drama, Horror","Lions Gate Films, Anagram Pictures, Astral Media",English,R,29172,6.7,70.0,8000000.0,304533.0,426224.0,"neighbor,suburb,classroom,character name as title,timeframe 1950s",0,0,13,28,1,1.0,15,11,March,1.4490275856093875,11592220.6848751,-10974610.351226324, Horror

tt0463998,Freedom Writers,Freedom Writers (2007),Movie,2007,2007-01-05,123.0,"Its 1994 in Long Beach, California. Idealistic Erin Gruwell is just starting her first teaching job, that as freshman and sophomore English teacher at Woodrow Wilson High School, which, two years earlier, implemented a voluntary integration program. For many of the existing teachers, the integration has ruined the school, whose previously stellar academic standing has been replaced with many students who will be lucky to graduate or even be literate. Despite choosing the school on purpose because of its integration program, Erin is unprepared for the nature of her classroom, whose students live by generations of strict moral codes of protecting their own at all cost. Many are in gangs and almost all know somebody that has been killed by gang violence. The Latinos hate the Cambodians who hate the blacks and so on. The only person the students hate more is Ms. Gruwell. It isnt until Erin holds an unsanctioned discussion about a recent drive-by shooting death that she fully begins to understand what shes up against. And it isnt until she provides an assignment of writing a daily journal - which will be not graded, and will remain unread by her unless they so choose - that the students begin to open up to her. As Erin tries harder and harder to have resources provided to teach properly (which often results in her needing to pay for them herself through working second and third jobs), she seems to face greater resistance, especially from her colleagues, such as Margaret Campbell, her section head, who lives by regulations and sees such resources as a waste, and Brian Gelford, who will protect his priviledged position of teaching the senior honors classes at all cost. Erin also finds that her teaching job is placing a strain on her marriage to Scott Casey, a man who seems to have lost his own idealistic way in life.","Awards, 2 wins & 1 nomination",Richard LaGravenese,"Richard LaGravenese, Freedom Writers, Erin Gruwell","Hilary Swank, Imelda Staunton, Patrick Dempsey","Biography, Crime, Drama","Paramount Pictures, Double Feature Films, MTV Films","English, Spanish",PG-13,77565,7.6,64.0,21000000.0,36605602.0,43095175.0,"based on real person,teacher,racism,1990s,f rated",0,0,2,3,3,3.0,13,234,January,1.4490275856093875,30429579.297797136,32016518.083866898, Crime

Electrician and sometimes rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof lives hard, which includes heavy smoking, drinking, drug use (primarily cocaine) and casual sex. He is racist and homophobic. While in the hospital on a work related injury, the doctors discover and inform him that he is HIV+, and that he will most-likely die within thirty days. Ron is initially in angry denial that he would have a disease that only faggots have, but upon quick reflection comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. He begins to read whatever research is available about the disease, which at this time seems to be most effectively treated by the drug AZT. AZT, however, is only in the clinical trials stage within the US. Incredulous that he, as a dying man, cannot pay for any drug which may save or at least prolong his life, he goes searching for it by whatever means possible. It eventually leads him to Mexico and a Dr. Vass, an American physician whose license was revoked in the US because of his AIDS related work against US regulations. Dr. Vass leads Ron to a cocktail of other drugs, some vitamins, he believes are more effective in treating the symptoms, since the virus, as Ron learns, will always be in the system of those who have been exposed to it. Ron begins to smuggle these drugs not approved by the FDA into the US, not only for his own use but for sale to other HIV+ persons. In this venture, he goes into an unlikely partnership with a HIV+ transgender woman named Rayon, who he met in the hospital and who has greater contact with AIDS patients through the gay community. As they try to work both above ground to get the meds to those that need them and underground to avoid detection by especially the FDA, Ron comes up with an idea to circumvent the fact of selling the drugs - which are not considered drugs yet since they are not FDA approved - directly to the HIV+ population, which then should should not be against the law. Richard Barkley and Dr. Sevard, the FDAs lead man on the file and one of Rons doctors respectively, the latter who sees clinical trials as the only way to determine the efficacy of drugs despite the fact that Ron and others would have probably died already without these drugs, try to stop Ron and Rayon at every turn. Caught in the middle is Dr. Eve Saks, another of Rons doctors, who understands why policies are in place, but who can sympathize with Ron, Rayon and others - all her patients, directly or indirectly - in their situation.","Won 3 Oscars, 84 wins & 87 nominations total",Jean-Marc Vallée,"Craig Borten, Melisa Wallack","Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner, Jared Leto","Biography, Drama","Truth Entertainment (II), Voltage Pictures, r2 films","English, Japanese",R,477548,7.9,79.0,5000000.0,27298285.0,55736588.0,"hiv,gay community,homophobia,drugs,hiv positive",3,3,84,171,4,1.5,36,4,November,1.273584308019702,6367921.54009851,64617322.31926072, Drama

As Pauls relationship with the entire family grows (which includes his hiring Jules to design and construct his backyard), they have an effect on what he wants in life.

Set on a long English summer in the early 80s, SON OF RAMBOW is a comedy about friendship, faith and the tough business of growing up. We see the story through the eyes of Will, the eldest son of a fatherless Plymouth Brethren family. The Brethren regard themselves as Gods chosen ones and their strict moral code means that Will has never been allowed to mix with the other worldlies, listen to music or watch TV, until he finds himself caught up in the extraordinary world of Lee Carter, the school terror and maker of bizarre home movies. Carter exposes Will to a pirate copy of Rambo: First Blood and from that moment Wills mind is blown wide open and hes easily convinced to be the stuntman in Lee Carters diabolical home movie. Wills imaginative little brain is not only given chance to flourish in the world of film making, but is also very handy when it comes to dreaming up elaborate schemes to keep his partnership with Lee Carter a secret from the Brethren community. Will and Carters complete disregard for consequences and innocent ambition means that the process of making their film is a glorious roller-coaster that eventually leads to true friendship. They start to make a name for themselves at school as movie makers but when popularity descends on them in the form of the Pied Piper-esque French exchange student, Didier Revol, their unique friendship and their precious film are pushed, quite literally, to breaking point.","Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award, 3 wins & 10 nominations total",Garth Jennings,Garth Jennings,"Bill Milner, Will Poulter, Jessica Hynes","Action, Adventure, Comedy","Hammer & Tongs, Celluloid Dreams, Good Film Productions","English, French",PG-13,31771,7.0,66.0,4000000.0,1785505.0,10871449.0,"friendship between boys,plymouth brethren,foreign exchange student,young love,absent mother",0,0,3,13,4,3.0,5,2,May,1.409559908180338,5638239.632721352,9685719.021505876, Adventure

The world is gray and getting quickly grayer as more and more things die off. A man and his pre-teen son, who was born after the apocalypse, are currently on the road, their plan to walk to the coast and head south where the man hopes there will be a more hospitable environment in which to live. The man has taught his son that they are the good people who have fire in their hearts, which in combination largely means that they will not resort to cannibalism to survive. The man owns a pistol with two bullets remaining, which he will use for murder/suicide of him and his son if he feels that that is a better fate for them than life in the alternative. Food and fuel are for what everyone is looking. The man has taught his son to be suspect of everyone that they may meet, these strangers who, out of desperation, may not only try to steal what they have managed to scavenge for their own survival, but may kill them as food. Although life with his father in this world is all the boy has known, he may come to his own thoughts as to what it means holistically to be one of the good or one of the bad. Meanwhile, the man occasionally has thoughts to happier times with his wife/the boys mother before the apocalypse, as well as not as happy times with her after the apocalypse and the reason she is no longer with them.","Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award, 5 wins & 34 nominations total",John Hillcoat,"Joe Penhall, Cormac McCarthy","Viggo Mortensen, Charlize Theron, Kodi Smit-McPhee","Adventure, Drama","Dimension Films, 2929 Productions, Nick Wechsler Productions",English,R,235956,7.2,64.0,25000000.0,8117000.0,27639579.0,"apocalypse,on the road,cannibalism,cataclysm,suicide contemplation",0,0,5,39,4,1.5,23,44,November,1.3579575223317322,33948938.058293305,3584436.1588388714, Drama

Sarah threatens to send Andie to live with relatives in Texas unless she cleans up her act, which includes ending her association with the 410 and trying harder at school. Andies neighborhood friend, Tyler Gage, convinces Andie to audition for entry into the Maryland School of the Arts (MSA), an institution which ended up turning his life around for the better. Andie passes the audition but isnt sure she fits in there. The schools director, Blake Collins, isnt sure she fits in there either. Blake is a brilliant dancer but looks for conformity to his way. After learning that Andies absences from rehearsals are due to her new association with MSA, Tuck kicks her out of the 410. Chase Collins, a dance student at MSA, convinces Andie to start her own street dance crew using all the dance misfits from MSA i.e. those that dont conform to Blakes way of thinking. Chase feels like hes one of those misfits being Blakes brother and living in his shadow. This new association brings up a few conflicts within Andie, as her new dance crew tries to gain respect on the streets, especially among her old and judgmental friends, and as she and the crew try to hide the fact of what theyre doing from Blake, who ultimately threatens expulsion from the school of anyone participating in the illegal street competitions.","Awards, 2 wins & 3 nominations",Jon M.

The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldnt be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items. However they are on a race for time as if they cant find Doug in the next few hours, they are going to have to explain to Tracy why they are not yet back in Los Angeles. And even worse, they may not find Doug at all before the wedding.","Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award, 13 wins & 25 nominations total",Todd Phillips,"Jon Lucas, Scott Moore","Zach Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper, Justin Bartha",Comedy,"Warner Bros., Legendary Entertainment, Green Hat Films",English,R,767599,7.7,73.0,35000000.0,277339746.0,469328079.0,"hangover,bachelor party,implied cunnilingus,fellatio,morning after",0,0,13,38,9,6.0,17,286,June,1.3579575223317322,47528513.28161062,589799082.0379409,Comedy

Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burrys beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burrys information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennetts prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old friend, retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and dont know whats going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process.","Won 1 Oscar, 37 wins & 81 nominations total",Adam McKay,"Charles Randolph, Adam McKay, Michael Lewis","Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling","Biography, Comedy, Drama","Paramount Pictures, New Regency Productions, Plan B Entertainment",English,R,415783,7.8,81.0,28000000.0,70259870.0,133440870.0,"mortgage,finance,bank,banking,short selling",1,1,37,118,7,4.0,37,234,December,1.2350028199252376,34580078.957906656,130219771.7853704, Comedy

After to escape, all the next Pilgrims were created with the protocols to limit their capacity in order to have them under control. Fearing the extinction of human race if all the Pilgrims evolve beyond the protocols, ROCs chairman blames Vaucan of Duprés assassination and the alteration of the robots to cover up to the public, and Wallace is hired to find Cleo and Vucan and kill them. According Vaucan, Cleo and three robots more travel across the desert to the forbidden and radioactive zone to meet The Clocksmith, Vaucan will find himself as witness of something that it would change the world as nobody could imagine.","Awards, 6 nominations",Gabe Ibáñez,"Gabe Ibáñez, Igor Legarreta, Javier Sánchez Donate","Antonio Banderas, Birgitte Hjort Sørensen, Dylan McDermott","Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Green Moon, Nu Boyana Viburno",English,R,56683,6.0,37.0,7000000.0,,6237990.0,"robot,future,dystopia,child hitman,self repair",0,0,0,6,1,1.0,15,1,October,1.2547628650440414,8783340.05530829,-956141.85079221, Sci-Fi

That day, mine foreman, Luis Don Lucho Urzúa, reported his concerns to mine owner, Carlos Castillo, about the unstable nature of the mountain under which the mine is located, those concerns which went unheeded. Don Lucho one of the thirty-three, went to work as usual into the mine, when that instability led to collapse in some of the underground shafts, the thirty-three who were able to make it to the refuge area, however with communication channels to the surface inoperable. Under normal circumstances, the refuge area had enough supplies to last thirty men three days. The miners also discovered that the company had failed to place the requisite ladders from the refuge area to the surface, and that the primary route out was now blocked by a shifted rock, its mass the equivalent of the Empire State Building. The thirty-three were ultimately led by Mario Sepúlveda, who was not going to let any of the thirty-three take priority over any of the others, especially in the initial panic and instinct for self-survival among some. On the surface, loved ones of the trapped miners held vigil at the mine, with María Segovia, elder sister of trapped miner Dario Segovia, arguably the most outspoken in condemnation of the powers that be not doing anything to search for the miners, not knowing if they were dead or alive, but who was also quick to give praise where praise was due. That praise largely went to the relatively new Minister of Mines, Laurence Golborne, who was determined both to do whatever he could on behalf of the government to look for the men and to provide accurate assessments to those holding vigil of the situation, especially in Castillo seeing miner deaths solely as an unfortunate nature of the business. The chief engineer assigned to drill toward the refuge area in the hopes that the miners were there was Andre Sougarret, who admitted that the process was not a scientific one as one would have hoped. Once the miners were discovered alive in the refuge area, the next phase of trying to extract them held its own new challenges for all concerned, both logistical and emotional.","Awards, 8 wins & 7 nominations",Patricia Riggen,"Mikko Alanne, Craig Borten, Michael Thomas","Antonio Banderas, Rodrigo Santoro, Juliette Binoche","Biography, Drama, History","Alcon Entertainment, Phoenix Pictures, Los 33","English, Spanish",PG-13,37861,6.8,55.0,26000000.0,12227722.0,27972023.0,"survival,rescue,title directed by female,latin america,street vendor",0,0,8,15,2,1.6666666666666667,22,18,November,1.2350028199252376,32110073.318056177,2435453.965957427, Drama

Now past middle age, Riggan is trying to establish himself as a true artist by writing, directing, starring in and co-producing with his best friend Jake what is his Broadway debut, an adaptation of Raymond Carvers story, What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. He is staking his name, what little artistic reputation that comes with that name and his life savings on the project, and as such will do anything needed to make the play a success. As he and Jake go through the process of the previews toward opening night, Riggan runs into several issues: needing to find a replacement for the integral supporting male role the night before the first preview; hiring the talented Broadway name, Mike Shiner, for that role, Mike who ends up being difficult to work with and who may end up overshadowing Riggan in the play; having to deal potentially with a lawsuit based on one of his actions to ensure success; needing to be there for his daughter, Sam, who he has hired to be his production assistant and who has just come out of drug rehab; and pleasing the New York Times critic, Tabitha Dickinson, who wants to use any excuse to give the play a scathing review which in turn would close the show after the opening night performance. But Riggans biggest problem may be his own insecurities, which are manifested by him constantly hearing what he believes to be the truth from the voice of his Birdman character, who he often battles both internally and externally.","Won 4 Oscars, 193 wins & 292 nominations total",Alejandro G.

To do so, he decides to pose as Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, even going so far as to trap a lackadaisical misfit reindeer to pull his sleigh. Meanwhile, down in Whoville, Cindy-Lou Who (Cameron Seely), a young girl overflowing with holiday cheer, plots with her gang of friends to trap Santa Claus as he makes his Christmas Eve rounds so that she can thank him for help for her overworked single mother.

Although disdainful of this seemingly pointless chore, Armand travels to Auvers-sur-Oise where a purported close companion to Vincent, Dr. Gachet (Jerome Flynn), lives.

However, as Armand digs further, he comes to realize that Vincents troubled life is as much a matter of interpretation as his paintings, and there are no easy answers for a man whose work and tragedy would only be truly appreciated in the future.","Nominated for 1 Oscar, 23 wins & 53 nominations total","Dorota Kobiela, Hugh Welchman","Dorota Kobiela, Hugh Welchman, Jacek Dehnel","Douglas Booth, Jerome Flynn, Robert Gulaczyk","Animation, Biography, Crime","BreakThru Productions, Trademark Films, Silver Reel",English,PG-13,56718,7.8,62.0,5000000.0,6735118.0,42187665.0,"painting,artist,death,doctor,suicide",0,1,23,76,1,1.0,4,3,September,1.2179358843774566,6089679.421887283,45292191.65970759, Crime

Following Kates team leading a raid on a known drug den in nearby Chandler, Kate is recruited to work on a special ops team led by Matt Graver of the CIA, he who is on special assignment for the Department of Defense. They recruited her because they wanted someone with tactical procedures knowledge. Outwardly, the teams mission, which works behind a Delta Force team as its primary gun power as required, is to decapitate a Mexican drug cartel by capturing or dismembering the workings of the main players, cartel head Manuel Díaz, his second in command Guillermo Díaz (Manuels brother), and drug lord Fausto Alarcón. Kate agrees to the assignment as she feels the work of this team would be more effective in stopping the drug trade in the US than the piecemeal work of her current kidnap response unit. The third on the team is a mysterious Hispanic or Latino man Kate only knows as Alejandro, and who she does not fully trust as she can tell that he is suffering from a very traumatic past. When Kate and the team arrive in El Paso for their first mission, Kate learns that the teams workings are not all they appear on the surface - many of the proceedings which would not be considered above board or legal - despite the end goal being as she knows it to be. Still largely in the dark and only given information on a need to know basis, Kate decides to stick it out with the team if only to discover all that she is not told while still believing in the end goal. She may have changing or at least mixed emotions as she learns more and more about what is going on, including the specific reason why she was recruited.","Nominated for 3 Oscars, 15 wins & 158 nominations total",Denis Villeneuve,Taylor Sheridan,"Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin, Benicio Del Toro","Action, Crime, Drama","Lionsgate, Black Label Media, Thunder Road Pictures","English, Spanish",R,416410,7.6,82.0,30000000.0,46889293.0,84997446.0,"drug cartel,juarez mexico,war on drugs,death of daughter,secret tunnel",0,3,15,173,7,5.0,27,52,October,1.2350028199252376,37050084.59775713,67922000.89868598,Action

Her only experience of being in such an environment is going through hostile zone training a few years earlier. Immediately upon her arrival in Afghanistan, she realizes that she is ill-prepared emotionally for this assignment, not only enduring the dangers of the war itself, but also the conditions of everyday life, including largely been seen by men as only a piece of ass and a distraction despite her being considered average looking back home and not being overtly sexual, and being an individual with a small bladder who is nonetheless told to stay hydrated at all times. She is largely assisted in navigating this new life by Tanya Vanderpoel, a fellow female western correspondent, and Fahim Ahmadzai, her Afghan translator guide. As time goes on, Kim finds that she not only may have a specific and important voice within the press corps, but that she may be losing touch with her life back in the States for good or bad. In addition, she will have to decide how much she is willing to risk, not only for herself but that for her colleagues, to get that next important story. She also has to figure out how much of what she does truly is her, and how much is being as she and the other western press corps members state is being in the Kabubble. What may also affect her life is how much the war in Afghanistan is overtaken by other world events for which the American public is wanting information, and thus if Afghanistan has a specific time span in her life regardless of how much she may want to stay to tell what she sees as its important stories.","Awards, 1 nomination","Glenn Ficarra, John Requa","Robert Carlock, Kim Barker","Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, Martin Freeman","Biography, Comedy, Drama","Broadway Video, Little Stranger, Paramount Pictures","English, Pashtu, Dari, French",R,52427,6.6,57.0,35000000.0,23083334.0,24972139.0,"afghanistan,journalist,u.s. military,karaoke,dancing",0,0,0,1,4,1.0,19,51,March,1.2337690508743635,43181916.78060272,-12372064.548270045, Drama

The parents have passed their socialist and survivalist ideals to their children. Ben considers most of Western society to be fascist, especially corporate America. He also believes that no one will or should be there for you, so youd better learn how to take care of yourself. As such, the children have been subject to vigorous physical training; know how to deal with minor bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains, and even fractures; and know how to hunt, forage, and grow their own food. The children are also non-registered home schooled, meaning that they have no official academic records. Ben and Leslie have tried to make the children critical thinkers, however, within the context of their ideals. Beyond these issues, Ben and Leslie made the decision to live this lifestyle for Leslies health. Formerly an attorney, Leslie was diagnosed as bipolar. Ben believes that this disorder started with her postpartum depression with Bo. Yet Leslies condition has worsened. Despite not believing in Western medicine, Ben sends Leslie to a hospital close to Bens sister, Harper, so that there can be family close by. While hospitalized, Leslie commits suicide. Beyond the collective grief, Leslies act brings out a battle between Ben and Leslies father, Jack Bertrang, a Christian who not only blames Ben for Leslies death, but believes that what he is doing to the children can legally be considered abuse. Jack takes over the funeral arrangements as per his and his complacent wife Abbys Christian morals, against what Ben knows was Leslies wishes, as she believed in Buddhist philosophies. Although Jack threatens to call the police if Ben shows up to the funeral, Ben and the children believe it is their mission to honor Leslies last wishes to be cremated as per Buddhist philosophy. This mission not only may bring the divide between Jack and Ben to a head, but may also bring out some long dormant issues between the Cash children as they are exposed to commercial America in all its good and bad, and as Bo grows into manhood, he may have his own ideas of what he should do with the next phase of his life.","Nominated for 1 Oscar, 15 wins & 51 nominations total",Matt Ross,Matt Ross,"Viggo Mortensen, George MacKay, Samantha Isler","Comedy, Drama","Electric City Entertainment, ShivHans Pictures","English, Esperanto, German, Chinese",R,213996,7.8,72.0,5000000.0,5879835.0,23123592.0,"funeral,suicide,suicide of mother,reference to noam chomsky,loss of wife",0,1,15,66,1,1.0,10,4,July,1.2337690508743635,6168845.254371817,22360326.900274206, Drama

tt4276820,The Founder,The Founder (2016),Movie,2016,2017-01-20,115.0,"1954. Having worked as a salesman most of his adult life, Ray Kroc has been a hustler in most senses of the word. That hustling has made him the target of derision among certain circles for peddling what have ended up being more novelty or faddish than useful products, but it has also placed more than a comfortable roof in Arlington Heights, Illinois over his and his wife Ethels heads. Ethel, however, wishes that he placed as much effort into being at home with her as he does in selling; his current job of peddling five-spindle milkshake makers for Prince Castle which has him constantly on the road going from one drive-in restaurant to another. It is because of the beefs he has with the whole drive-in experience (bad food, bad service) in constantly eating at such establishments while on the road that he becomes enthralled with the concept of McDonalds Restaurant in San Bernardino, California, owned and operated by brothers Richard McDonald and Maurice McDonald - Dick and Mac. Unlike most of Rays customers who will only require one five-spindle milkshake maker at any given time, the McDonald brothers end up purchasing eight machines for their single restaurant. Primarily on Dicks initiative, the brothers have redesigned the whole concept of the drive-in restaurant to focus on quality food through a smaller menu of only the most popular items (hamburgers, fries, sodas), consistency in product so that customers know what to expect from time to time, change in the target market from lounging teenagers to families, and perhaps most importantly speed in having any order ready within seconds, many of these goals achievable through assembly line styled production. They had tried franchising previously, but failed in that they lost control over many of those aspects which made their San Bernardino restaurant successful. Despite believing Ray a bit off kilter (in other words, crazy), the McDonald brothers somewhat hesitantly enter into a contract with him to be their head of franchising. Rays experience in the job is not without its problems, especially as his franchisees seem to be making more money than he is, he who is only breaking even. He is not averse to advancing ideas provided to him to get ahead - original ideas which are not his forte - he seeing the brothers as his biggest problem in they thinking small. These differences lead to a standoff between Ray and the brothers, the former who has a different goal for his business in profit and stoking his own ego seemingly his main priorities.","Awards, 1 win & 5 nominations",John Lee Hancock,Robert Siegel,"Michael Keaton, Nick Offerman, John Carroll Lynch","Biography, Drama","The Weinstein Company, FilmNation Entertainment, Faliro House Productions","English, Yiddish",PG-13,145814,7.2,66.0,25000000.0,12786053.0,24121245.0,"swindle,burger,franchising,fast food,mcdonald&apos;s restaurant",0,0,1,6,5,2.0,10,24,January,1.2179358843774566,30448397.10943641,-1070267.2480761118, Drama

She will have to start from the ground up again if she wants a writing career, as, hiding behind her subjects, the book buying public will not buy a Lee Israel on the strength of her name in not knowing who she is as a writer or person. This situation has led to her being months behind in rent as she spends whatever little money she has on alcohol and Jerseys medical needs. In doing research for her latest book on Fanny Brice - with no advance from Marjorie - and selling a cherished personal memento of a handwritten letter from Katharine Hepburn in needing the money, Lee discovers there is a market for such celebrity memorabilia, and in the process decides, with her writing talent, to go into the fraudulent business of creating and selling fake personal documents purportedly by dead celebrities, especially of writers with strong public personas, such as Dorothy Parker and Noël Coward. She ends up befriending a gay past acquaintance from her literary circles, Jack Hock, also having fallen on hard times, Jack, not only becoming her drinking buddy, but her partner in crime. As they are able to get out of their financial holes in this business, Lee may begin to have second thoughts in also befriending Anna, one of the rare bookstore owners who likes Lee for Lee, an unusual position for her.

Despite ultimately garnering some success in figure skating being national champion, a world championship medalist, an Olympian, and being the first American woman to complete a Triple Axel in competition, she is arguably best known for her association to the incident: the leg bashing on January 6, 1994 of her competitor, Nancy Kerrigan, who, unlike Tonya, was everything that the figure-skating community wanted in their representatives. Her association to that incident led to Tonya being banned from competitive figure skating for life. Tonyas story from the beginning of her figure-skating life at age four to the aftermath of the incident is presented. Besides Tonya herself, key people in her life give their perspective of their role in her life. Although they may agree on the broad issues at hand, such as that the incident did occur, they may vary widely in their recollection of the details. These people are: her waitress mother Lavona Golden, who despite having paid for her expensive figure-skating lessons, was abusive toward her physically and emotionally, never believing she being good enough in any aspect of the word, and who pulled her from school to focus solely on the figure skating; Diane Rawlinson, her first and longest serving coach, who, for good or bad, largely let Tonya be Tonya in the way she presented herself to the figure skating world; Jeff Gillooly, her first husband, the two who also had a turbulent relationship on a need to be loved perhaps without truly loving the other; Jeffs friend and Tonyas bodyguard Shawn Eckardt, a dim bulb who believed himself to be a bigger player in the big scheme of life than he actually was; and sports journalist Martin Maddox, a fictional character who provides general commentary of what the sports media as a collective wanted out of Tonya and the incident.","Won 1 Oscar, 45 wins & 127 nominations total",Craig Gillespie,Steven Rogers,"Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan, Allison Janney","Biography, Comedy, Drama","AI-Film, Clubhouse Pictures (II), Georgia Film, Music & Digital Entertainment Office",English,R,208290,7.5,77.0,11000000.0,30014539.0,53939297.0,"ice skating,violence,abusive mother,abuse,female protagonist",1,1,45,172,7,3.0,9,2,January,1.1928852932198402,13121738.225418242,51221655.892498806, Drama

Halley, who survives largely on welfare, has little respect for people, especially those who cross her, it an attitude that she has passed down to Moonee, who curses and gives the finger like her mother. Although the motels policy is not to allow long term rentals, Bobby, the motel manager, has made arrangements for people like Halley to live there while not undermining the policy as he realizes that many such tenants have no place to go otherwise. Halley, Moonee and Moonees friends, who live in the motel or others like it along the strip and who she often drags into her disruptive pranks, are often the bane of Bobbys existence, but while dealing with whatever problem arises, Bobby has a soft spot especially for the children and thus, by association, their parents, as he knows that Moonee and others like her are just children acting like a children under whatever guidance they have, Moonee who has less guidance than most. Although there are some lines which he will not tolerate to be crossed, Bobby lets most of the disruptive things that they do go, largely as long as it does not affect the bread and butter of the motel, namely the tourist trade. The summer in this collective is presented, when Moonee and her friends, such as Scooty, are out of school and are left largely to their own devices while self-absorbed Halley does whatever she wants, often just staying in the room watching TV. Halley is supposed to look after Scooty, the son of Halleys friend Ashley, they who live in the unit immediately underneath Halley and Moonees, while Ashley is at work at a local diner. In turn, Ashley pilfers cooked meals from the diner to feed Halley, Moonee and Scooty. Over the course of the summer, Halley systematically begins to alienate one by one the people who are her unofficial support by responding with that disrespect to anything she feels is against her. As such, Halley begins to take more and more extreme measures to maintain the life she leads with Moonee.","Nominated for 1 Oscar, 66 wins & 133 nominations total",Sean Baker,"Sean Baker, Chris Bergoch","Brooklynn Prince, Bria Vinaite, Willem Dafoe",Drama,"Cre Film, Freestyle Picture Company, June Pictures","English, Spanish, Portuguese",R,110978,7.6,92.0,2000000.0,5904366.0,10954677.0,"poverty,motel manager,little girl,motel,disneyworld",0,1,66,199,2,2.0,23,3,November,1.2179358843774566,2435871.768754913,10906222.45130947,Drama

It is seen as the tourist church or the souvenir shop (its historical significance partly it being a stop on the underground railroad before the slaves crossed into Canada) by Abundant Life, which owns the church and which operates a modern self-named five thousand seat church overseen by Reverend Joel Jeffers. First Reformed is celebrating its two hundred fiftieth anniversary this year, for which a major event is planned, modest in size only at First Reformed itself although the dignitaries like the governor and mayor will be at attendance there, while the event will be simulcast at Abundant Life. Most of the speech-making will be done by local industrialist Ed Balq, a major benefactor of Abundant Life and who is the major donor for the necessary upgrades at First Reformed to be able to hold the event there, and for the event itself, while Tollers participation will be minimal beyond the introductory sermon. First Reformed is generally a sparsely attended church meaning that Toller doesnt have to do much direct ministering, although he does have the stock answers when asked how God factors into this or that situation in ones life. Toller himself has long been divorced, his marriage which could not survive the death of their son, Joseph, in war. Because of that history, Toller believes he is incapable of human love, despite a brief relationship with Esther, the choir mistress at Abundant Life, she who is arguably still in love with him. Toller is neglecting the warning signs about his poor health, the symptoms pointing to a probable diagnosis of stomach cancer, which is only exacerbated by his largely liquid (i.e. alcohol) diet. Toller is already examining his life and work in writing a daily journal for a year, that journal which he intends no one ever to read, but these issues in Tollers life become more pointed when a new pregnant congregant, Mary, asks him to speak to her husband Michael, who Toller will learn is an environmentalist concerned about bringing another human life into what he already sees as a world doomed because of mans role in climate change.","Nominated for 1 Oscar, 60 wins & 109 nominations total",Paul Schrader,Paul Schrader,"Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer","Drama, Mystery, Thriller","Killer Films, Omeira Studio Partners, Fibonacci Films",English,R,55232,7.1,85.0,3500000.0,3448256.0,3862498.0,"priest as protagonist,church,priest,climate change,religion",0,1,60,169,2,3.0,24,4,May,1.1928852932198402,4175098.526269441,432418.53302160563,Drama

In getting the job, Ki-woo further learns that Mrs. Park is looking for an art therapist for the Parks adolescent son, Da-song, Ki-woo quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend Jessica, really Ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest liar of the four Kims.

The most difficult to get rid of may be Moon-gwang, the Parks housekeeper who literally came with the house - she Namgoongs housekeeper when he lived there - and thus knows all the little nooks and crannies of it better than the Parks themselves.

Given that the 27-year-old stand-up comic achieved fame as a teenager himself through YouTube by riffing on his insecurities, he is uniquely capable as the films writer and director to tell the story of Kayla, an anxious girl navigating the final days of her eighth grade year, despite creating a protagonist female instead of male. Like Burnham did more than a decade ago, 13-year-old Kayla turns to YouTube to express herself, where she makes advice blogs in which she pretends to have it all together. In reality, Kayla is sullen and silent around her single father and her peers at school, carrying out most of her interactions with her classmates on Instagram and Twitter. Her YouTube videos are a clever narrative tool that provide insight into her inner hopes and dreams, much like an inspirational online diary.
