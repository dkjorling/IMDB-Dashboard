# IMDB-Dashboard
Our group created an IMDB dashboard containing 3 separate tabs. The first tab contains our EDA plots, the second tab is linked to a fully connected neural network that we trained to estimate gross profit, and the third is an nlp study that yields movies similar to description user types in.

My responsibilities included: data cleaning, feature engineering, neural network training and designing the neural network tab in the dashboard.
